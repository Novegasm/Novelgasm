      <h3> PREVIEW:</h3>
  
<p><br>“Let's start with the end,” Mr. Whittier would say.<br><br>He'd say, “Let's start with a plot spoiler.”<br><br>The meaning of life. A unified field theory. The big reason why.<br><br>We'd all be sitting in the Arabian Nights gallery, sitting cross-legged on silk pillows and cushions stained with spots of mildew. Chairs and sofas that stunk of dirty laundry when you sat down and pushed the air out of them. There, under the high-up, echoing dome, painted in jewel colors that would never see daylight, never fade, among the brass lamps hanging down, each with a red or blue or orange lightbulb shining through the cage of patterns cut out of the brass, Mr. Whittier would sit there, eating dried something in crunching handfuls from a Mylar bag.<br><br>He'd say, “Let's get the big, big surprise over and done with.”<br><br>The earth, he'd say, is just a big machine. A big processing plant. A factory. That's your big answer. The big truth.<br><br>Think of a rock polisher, one of those drums, goes round and round, rolls twenty-four/seven, full of water and rocks and gravel. Grinding it all up. Round and round. Polishing those ugly rocks into gemstones. That's the earth. Why it goes around. We're the rocks. And what happens to us—the drama and pain and joy and war and sickness and victory and abuse—why, that's just the water and sand to erode us. Grind us down. To polish us up, nice and bright.<br><br>That's what Mr. Whittier would tell you.<br><br>Smooth as glass, that's our Mr. Whittier. Buffed by pain. Polished and shining.<br><br>That's why we love conflict, he says. We love to hate. To stop a war, we declare war on it. We must wipe out poverty. We must fight hunger. We campaign and challenge and defeat and destroy.<br><br>As human beings, our first commandment is:<br><br>Something needs to happen.<br><br>Mr. Whittier had no idea he was so right.<br><br>The more Mrs. Clark talked, the more we could see this wouldn't be the Villa Diodati. The babe who wrote Frankenstein, she was the kid of two writers: professors famous for think-tank books called Political Justice and A Vindication of the Rights of Women. They had famous smart people crashing at their house all the time.<br><br>We were no summer-house party of brainy bookworms.<br><br>No, the best story we'd bring out of this building would be just how we survived. How crazy Lady Baglady died cradled in our weeping arms. Still, that story would have to be good enough. Exciting enough. Scary and dangerous enough. We'd have to make sure it was.<br><br>Mr. Whittier and Mrs. Clark were too busy droning on. We needed them to get rough with us. Our story needed them to flog and beat us.<br><br>Not bore us to death.<br><br>“Any call for world peace,” Mr. Whittier would say, “is a lie. A pretty, pretty lie.” Just another excuse to fight.<br><br>No, we love war.<br><br>War. Starvation. Plague. They fast-track us to enlightenment.<br><br>“It's the mark of a very, very young soul,” Mr. Whittier used to say, “to try and fix the world. To try and save anyone from their ration of misery.”<br><br>We have always loved war. We are born knowing that war is why we're here. And we love disease. Cancer. We love earthquakes. In this amusement-park fun house we call the planet earth, Mr. Whittier says we adore forest fires. Oil spills. Serial killers.<br><br>We love terrorists. Hijackers. Dictators. Pedophiles.<br><br>God, how we love the television news. The pictures of people lining up beside a long, open grave, waiting to be shot by another new firing squad. The glossy newsmagazine photos of more everyday people torn to bloody shreds by suicide bombers. The radio bulletins about freeway pile-ups. The mud slides. The sinking ships.<br><br>His quivering hands telegraphing the air, Mr. Whittier would say, “We love when airplanes crash.”<br><br>We adore pollution. Acid rain. Global warming. Famine.<br><br>No, Mr. Whittier had no idea . . .<br><br>The Duke of Vandals found every bag of anything that included beets. Any silver Mylar pillows rattling with the sliced beets inside, dry as poker chips.<br><br>Saint Gut-Free poked a hole in every bag that held any kind of pork or chicken or beef. Meat being something he can never digest.<br><br>All the Mylar bags puffed full of nitrogen gas, they were arranged by food, stuffed into brown boxes of corrugated cardboard. In the boxes stenciled “Dessert” were bags of dried cookies, rattling the way seeds would inside a dried gourd. Inside the boxes stenciled “Appetizers,” freeze-dried chicken wings rattled like old bones.<br><br>Out of her fear of getting fat, Miss America found every box stenciled “Desserts” and used Chef Assassin's carving knife to poke holes in every bag.<br><br>Just to speed up our suffering. Fast-track us to enlightenment.<br><br>One hole, and the nitrogen would leak out. Bacteria and air would leak in. All the mold spores that were killing Miss Sneezy, carried on the warm damp air, they'd be eating and breeding in each silver pocket of sweet-and-sour pork, breaded halibut, pasta salad.<br><br>Before Agent Tattletale snuck into the lobby to ruin every crêpe Suzette, he'd make sure no one was around.<br><br>Before Countess Foresight crept into the lobby to stab every silver bag that might contain even trace amounts of cilantro, she made sure Agent Tattletale was gone.<br><br>We each only ruined the food we hated.<br><br>Cross-legged in the Arabian Nights gallery, among the plaster pillars carved to look like elephants standing on their back legs, rearing up to support the ceiling with their front feet, his teeth crunching another handful of dried sticks and rocks, Mr. Whittier would say, “In our secret heart's heart, we love to root against the home team.”<br><br>Against humanity. It's us against us. You, the victim of yourself.<br><br>We love war because it's the only way we'll finish our work here. The only way we'll finish our souls, here on earth: The big processing station. The rock tumbler. Through pain and anger and conflict, it's the only path. To what, we don't know.<br><br>“But we forget so much when we're born,” he says.<br><br>Being born, it's as if you go inside a building. You lock yourself inside a building with no windows to see out. And after you're inside any building long enough, you forget how the outside looked. Without a mirror, you'd forget your own face.<br><br>He never seemed to notice how one of us was always missing from the gallery. No, Mr. Whittier just talked and talked, while somebody was always sneaking downstairs to destroy any Mylar bag that listed green peppers as an ingredient.<br><br>That's how it happened. How no one knew everyone else had the same plan. We each just wanted to raise the stakes a little. To make sure our rescue team wouldn't find us pillowed in silver bags of rich food, suffering from nothing but boredom and gout. Each suffering survivor, fifty pounds heavier than when Mr. Whittier took us hostage.<br><br>Of course, we each wanted to leave enough food to last until we were almost rescued. Those last couple days, when we were really fasting, hungry and suffering—we could stretch that to a couple weeks in the retelling.<br><br>The book. The movie. The television miniseries.<br><br>We'd starve just long enough to get what Comrade Snarky called “Death Camp Cheekbones.” The more ins and outs your face has, the better Miss America says you'll look on television.<br><br>Those vermin-proof bags were so tough, we'd each begged to borrow a knife from Chef Assassin, from his beautiful set of paring knives, chef's knives, cleavers, filleting knives and kitchen shears. Except for the Missing Link with his bear-trap jaw; he'd just use his teeth.<br><br>“You are permanent, but this life is not,” Mr. Whittier would say. “You don't expect to visit an amusement park, then stay forever.”<br><br>No, we're only visiting, and Mr. Whittier knows that. And we're born here to suffer.<br><br>“If you can accept that,” he says, “you can accept anything that happens in the world.”<br><br>The irony is, if you can accept that—you'll never again suffer.<br><br>Instead, you'll run toward torture. You'll enjoy pain.<br><br>Mr. Whittier had no idea he was so right.<br><br>At one point, that evening, Chef Assassin walked into the salon, still holding a boning knife in one hand. He looked at Whittier and said, “The washing machine is broke. Now you have to let us go . . .”<br><br>Mr. Whittier looked up, still crunching a mouthful of dried turkey Tetrazzini, he said, “What's wrong with the washer?”<br><br>And Chef Assassin held up something in his other hand, not the knife, something loose and dangling. He said, “Some desperate, hostage cook cut off the plug-in . . .”<br><br>The object dangling from his hand.<br><br>It's after that we couldn't wash clothes, another plot point for the story that would be our cash cow.<br><br>At that point, Mr. Whittier groaned and slipped the fingers of one hand inside the top of his pants. He said, “Mrs. Clark?” His fingers pressed the spot inside his belt, and he said, “Now, that hurts . . .”<br><br>Watching him, twirling his rope of cut-off plug-in, Chef Assassin said, “I hope it's cancer.”<br><br>His fingers still in his pants, sunk in his Arabian cushions, Mr. Whittier bends double to put his head between his knees.<br><br>Mrs. Clark steps forward, saying, “Brandon?”<br><br>And Mr. Whittier slips to the floor, his knees pulled to his chest, moaning.<br><br>In our heads, for the scene in the movie, this scene only with a movie star twisting in fake pain on the red-and-blue Oriental carpet, in our heads, we're all writing down: “Brandon!”<br><br>Mrs. Clark squats down to lift the empty Mylar bag from where he's dropped it among the silk cushions. Her eyes twitch across the words stenciled there, and she says, “Oh, Brandon.”<br><br>All of us trying to be the camera behind the camera behind the camera. The last story in line. The truth.<br><br>In the future movie and TV miniseries version of this scene, we're all coaching a famous beauty-queen actress to say: “Oh my God, Brandon! Oh, dear sweet suffering Jesus!”<br><br>Mrs. Clark holds the bag for him to see, and she says, “You just ate the equivalent of ten turkey dinners . . .” She says, “Why?”<br><br>And Mr. Whittier moans. “Because,” he says, “I'm still a growing boy . . .”<br><br>In the future version, the beauty queen cries: “You're splitting apart inside! You're going to explode like a burst appendix!”<br><br>In the movie version, Mr. Whittier is screaming, his shirt stretched tight over his swelling belly, his fingernails claw the buttons open. Just then the tight skin starts to tear, the way a nylon stocking gaps open. Red blood spouts straight out, the way a whale clears its blowhole. A blood fountain that makes the audience scream.<br><br>In reality, his shirt looks a little tight. His hands unbuckle his belt. They pop open the top button of his pants. Mr. Whittier cuts a fart.<br><br>Mrs. Clark holds out a glass of water, saying, “Here, Brandon. Drink something.”<br><br>And Saint Gut-Free says, “No water. He'll only bloat more.”<br><br>Mr. Whittier, his body twists until he's stretched out on his stomach against the red-and-blue carpet. Each breath comes fast and short as a dog panting.<br><br>“It's his diaphragm,” Saint Gut-Free says. The food expanding in his stomach, it's already absorbing moisture and blocking the duodenum at the bottom. The ten turkey Tetrazzini dinners are expanding upward, compressing his diaphragm, making it so his lungs can't inhale.<br><br>Saying this, Saint Gut-Free is still eating handfuls of dried something from his own silver bag. Chewing and talking at the same time.<br><br>Another happening inside could be the stomach splitting, fouling the abdominal cavity with blood and bile and growing bits of turkey meat. Bacteria spilling from the small intestine. Leading to peritonitis, Saint Gut-Free says, an infection of the cavity wall.<br><br>In our movie version, Saint Gut-Free is tall with a straight nose and thick-framed glasses. He has a shock of thick, wild hair. A stethoscope hangs on his chest as he says duodenum and peritoneum. Not with his mouth full. In the movie, he holds out one hand, palm-up, and demands: “Scalpel!”<br><br>In the version based-on-a-true-story, we boil water. We give Mr. Whittier shots of brandy and a bullet to bite. We mop Saint Gut-Free's forehead with a little sponge while a clock tick-tocks, tick-tocks, tick-tocks, loud.<br><br>The noble victims saving their villain. The way we helped comfort poor Lady Baglady.<br><br>In reality, we just stand here. Our hands, waving away his fart smell. We're maybe wondering how Whittier will play this scene, if he'll live or die. We really need a director. Someone to tell each one of us what our character would do.<br><br>Mr. Whittier just moans, stroking his sides with his hands.<br><br>Mrs. Clark just leans over him. Her breasts looming, she says, “Here, someone help me get him to his room . . .”<br><br>Still nobody moves to help. We need for him to die. We can still make Mrs. Clark the evil villain.<br><br>Then Miss America says it. She steps up beside his bloated stomach, face-down, his shirttails pulled out of his pants, the elastic of his underwear showing as his waistband rides down. Miss America steps up and—oomph!—her shoe kicks into the stretched-tight side of his belly. It's then she says, “Now, where's the goddamn key?”<br><br>And Mrs. Clark bends an arm and elbows her back, away from the body. Mrs. Clark says, “Yes, Brandon. We need to get you to a hospital.”<br><br>In his own way, Mr. Whittier did. He gave us the key. His stomach pulling apart on the inside, the cavities of him filling with blood, the dried chips of turkey still expanding, soaking up blood and water and bile, getting bigger until the skin of his belly looks pregnant. Until his bellybutton pops out, poked out stiff as a little finger.<br><br>All of this, it takes place in the spotlight of Agent Tattletale's camera, him taping over the death of Lady Baglady. Replacing yesterday's tragic scene with today's.<br><br>The Earl of Slander holds his tape recorder close, using the same cassette, betting this horror will be worse than the last.<br><br>This moment, it's a plot point we've never dared dream. The first-act climax that would make our lives worth cash money. Mr. Whittier's busting open, the event we could witness to become someone famous, a famous authority. Like Lady Baglady's ear, Mr. Whittier's belly splitting open was our ticket. A blank check. A free pass.<br><br>We were all soaking it up. Absorbing the event. Digesting the experience into a story. A screenplay. Something we could sell.<br><br>The way his pumpkin belly subsided a little, going a bit flat when the pressure collapsed his diaphragm. We studied how his face, his mouth stretched open, his teeth biting for more air. More air.<br><br>“An inguinal hernia,” Saint Gut-Free said. And we all said those words under our breath to better remember.<br><br>“To the stage . . . ,” Mr. Whittier says, his face buried in the dusty carpet. He says, “I'm ready to recite . . .”<br><br>An inguinal hernia . . . , we all echo in our heads. What's happened so far wouldn't make a good joke. All these idiots fooled into a building and trapped. The ringleader gets gas, and we escape. That's just NOT going to play.<br><br>Already, Mother Nature is planning to take off her choker of brass bells and sneak him some water.<br><br>Director Denial is planning to walk Cora Reynolds past his room and smuggle in a big pitcher of water.<br><br>The Missing Link sees himself tiptoeing to Mr. Whittier's dressing room all night long, ladling water down his throat until the man goes: ka-boom.<br><br>“Please, Tess?” Mr. Whittier says. He says, “Would you help me to bed?”<br><br>And we all jot a note in our heads: Tess and Brandon, our jailers.<br><br>“Hurry, to the stage . . . I'm cold,” Mr. Whittier says while Mother Nature helps him to his feet.<br><br>“Probably shock,” Saint Gut-Free says.<br><br>In the version we'll sell, he's already a goner. One villain will die, and his she-villain will torment the rest of us in her rage. Mistress Tess, holding us captive. Depriving us of food. Forcing us to wear dirty rags. We, being her innocent victims.<br><br>Saint Gut-Free stands to put an arm around Mr. Whittier. Mother Nature helps. Mrs. Clark follows with her glass of water. The Earl of Slander with his tape recorder. Agent Tattletale, his video camera.<br><br>“Trust me,” Saint Gut-Free says. “I happen to know a lot about human insides.”<br><br>As if we still needed her to die, Miss Sneezy sneezes into her fist. Miss Sneezy, the future ghost of here.<br><br>Wiping the spray from her arm, Comrade Snarky says, “Gross!” She says, “Were you raised in a plastic bubble or what?”<br><br>And Miss Sneezy says, “Yeah, pretty much.”<br><br>The Matchmaker excuses himself, saying he's tired and needs some sleep. And he sneaks down to the subbasement to sabotage the furnace.<br><br>He couldn't guess, but the Duke of Vandals has already beat him to that punch.<br><br>This leaves the rest of us sitting on the silk cushions and pillows spotted with mildew under the Arabian Nights dome. The silver bag of turkey Tetrazzini empty on the carpet. The carved elephant pillars.<br><br>In our heads, we're all jotting down the line: I happen to know a lot about human insides . . .<br><br>And nothing more happens. More nothing happens.<br><br>Until the rest of us unfold our legs and slap the dust from our clothes. We head for the auditorium, our fingers crossed we'll hear Mr. Whittier's last words.<br><br>Erosion<br><br>A Poem About Mr. Whittier<br><br>“The same mistakes we made as cavemen,” says Mr. Whittier, “we still make.”<br><br>So maybe we're supposed to fight and hate and torture each other . . .<br><br>Mr. Whittier rolls his wheelchair to the edge of the stage,<br><br>with his spotted hands, his bald head.<br><br>The folds of his slack face seem to hang<br><br>from his too-big eyes, his cloudy, watery-gray eyes.<br><br>The ring looped through one of his nostrils, the earphones of his CD player looped around the wrinkles and folds of his beef-jerky neck.<br><br>Onstage, instead of a spotlight, a black-and-white movie fragment:<br><br>Mr. Whittier's head is wallpapered with newsreel armies marching.<br><br>His mouth and eyes lost in the shadow boots and bayonets that worm across his cheeks.<br><br>He says, “Maybe suffering and misery is the point of life.”<br><br>Consider that the earth is a processing plant, a factory.<br><br>Picture a tumbler used to polish rocks:<br><br>A rolling drum filled with water and sand.<br><br>Consider that your soul is dropped in as an ugly rock,<br><br>some raw material or a natural resource, crude oil, mineral ore.<br><br>And all conflict and pain is just the abrasive that rubs us,<br><br>polishes our souls, refines us,<br><br>teaches and finishes us over lifetime after lifetime.<br><br>Then consider that you've chosen to jump in, again and again,<br><br>knowing this suffering is your entire reason for coming to earth.<br><br>Mr. Whittier, his teeth crowded too many in his narrow jawbone,<br><br>his dead-tumbleweed eyebrows, Mr. Whittier's bat-wing ears spread wide<br><br>with the shadow armies marching across,<br><br>he says,<br><br>“The only alternative is, we're all just eternally stupid.”<br><br>We fight wars. We fight for peace. We fight hunger. We love to fight.<br><br>We fight and fight and fight, with our guns or mouths or money.<br><br>And the planet is never one lick better than it was before us.<br><br>Leaning forward, both his hands clawed on the arms of his wheelchair,<br><br>as the newsreel armies march over his face, those moving tattoos<br><br>of their machine guns and tanks and artillery,<br><br>Mr. Whittier says: “Maybe we're living the exact way we're meant to live.”<br><br>Maybe our factory planet is processing our souls . . . just fine.<br><br>Dog Years<br><br>A Story by Brandon Whittier<br><br>These angels, they see themselves being. These agents of mercy.<br><br>Put together so much more nice than God had planned, with their rich husbands and good genetics and orthodontia and dermatology. These stay-at-home mothers with teenaged kids in school. At-home, but not homemakers. Not housewives.<br><br>Educated, sure, but not too smart.<br><br>They have help for all the rough work. Hired experts. They use the wrong scouring powder, and their granite countertops or limestone tile is worthless. The wrong fertilizer, and their landscaping gets burned. The wrong color paint, and all their careful effort, their investment, suffers. With the kids in school, and God at his office, the angels have all day to kill.<br><br>So here they are. Volunteers.<br><br>Where they can't screw up anything too important. Pushing the library cart around a retirement center. Between yoga and their book group. Hanging the Halloween decorations at an old-folks' home. Any old-age hospice, you'll find them, these angels of boredom.<br><br>These angels with their flat-soled shoes handmade in Italy. Their good intentions and art-history degrees and long afternoons to kill until the kids get home from soccer or ballet after school. These angels, pretty in their flower-print sundresses, their clean hair tied back. And smiling. Smiling. Every time you sneak a look.<br><br>With a nice word to say for every patient. A comment about what a nice collection of get-well cards you've arranged on the dresser. What nice African violets you grow in pots on your windowsill.<br><br>Mr. Whittier loves these angel women.<br><br>Always, for Mr. Whittier, the spotted, bald old man at the end of the hall, they say: What nice black-light, butt-rock concert posters he has taped above his bed. What a colorful skateboard he has propped beside the door.<br><br>Old Mr. Whittier, bug-eyed dwarf Mr. Whittier, he asks, “What's shaking, ladies?”<br><br>And the angels, they laugh.<br><br>At this old man who still plays at being so young. It's so sweet, his being so young at heart.<br><br>Sweet, goofy Mr. Whittier with his Internet surfing and snowboarder magazines. His CDs of hip-hop music. A brimmed cap, turned around backward on his head. Just like a high-school kid.<br><br>An ancient version of their own teenagers in school. They can't not flirt back. They can't not like him a little, with his spotted, backward-capped head between earphones, listening to head-banger rock so loud it leaks out.<br><br>Mr. Whittier in the hallway, parked in his wheelchair with one hand open, palm-up, he says, “Gimme five . . .”<br><br>And all the volunteer ladies slap his hand as they walk past.<br><br>Yes, please. That's how the angels want to turn ninety years old: Still with-it. Still hip to new trends. Not fossilized, the way they feel now . . .<br><br>In so many ways, this old man seems younger than any of the volunteers in their thirties or forties. These middle-aged angels a half or a third his age.<br><br>Mr. Whittier with his fingernails painted black. A silver ring looped through one honking-big, old-man nostril. Around his ankle, a tattoo of barbed wire shows above his cardboard bedroom slipper.<br><br>A clunky skull-face ring rattles loose around one stiff, little-stick finger.<br><br>Mr. Whittier blinking his milky-cataract eyes, saying, “How about you be my date for the high-school prom . . . ?”<br><br>All the angels, they blush. Giggling at this safe, funny old man. They sit on his wheelchair lap, their muscle-toned, personal-trained thighs perched on his sharp, bony knees.<br><br>It's only normal that, someday, an angel will gush. To the head nurse or an orderly, a volunteer will gush about what a wonderful youthful spirit Mr. Whittier has. How he's still so full of life.<br><br>At that, the nurse will look back, eyes not blinking, mouth open a moment, quiet a moment, before the nurse says, “Of course he acts young . . .”<br><br>The angel says, “We should all stay so full of life.”<br><br>So filled with high spirits. Such pep. So perky.<br><br>Mr. Whittier is just so inspirational. They say that a lot.<br><br>These angels of mercy. These angels of charity.<br><br>Those foolish, foolish angels.<br><br>And the nurse or orderly will say, “Most of us did . . . have that kind of pep.” Walking away, the nurse will say, “When we were his age.”<br><br>He's not old.<br><br>Here's how the truth always leaks out.<br><br>Mr. Whittier, he suffers from progeria. The truth is, he's eighteen years old, a teenager about to die of old age.<br><br>One out of eight million kids develops Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. A genetic defect in the protein lamin A will make their cells fall apart. Aging them at seven times the normal rate. Making teenaged Mr. Whittier, with his crowded teeth and big ears, his veined skull and bulging eyes, making his body 126 years old.<br><br>“You could say . . . ,” he always tells the angels, waving away their concern with one wrinkled hand, “you could say I'm aging in dog years,”<br><br>In another year, he'll be dead of heart disease. Of old age, before he's twenty.<br><br>After this, the angel doesn't turn up for a while. The truth is, it's just too sad. Here's a kid, maybe younger than one of her own teenagers, dying alone in a nursing home. This kid, still so full of life and reaching out for help, to the only people around—to her—before it's too late.<br><br>This is too much.<br><br>Still, every yoga class, every PTA meeting, each time she looks at a teenager, this angel wants to cry.<br><br>She has to do something.<br><br>So she goes back, with her smile toned down a little. She tells him, “I understand.”<br><br>She smuggles in a pizza. A new video game. She says, “Make a wish, and I'll help make it come true.”<br><br>This angel, she wheels him out a fire exit for a day riding rollercoasters. Or hanging out at the mall. This teenaged geezer and a beautiful woman, old enough to be his mother. She lets him slaughter her at paintball, the colors wrecking her hair. His wheelchair. She takes a dive at laser tag. She half carries his wrinkled half-naked carcass to the top of a waterslide, again and again, all of one hot, sunny afternoon.<br><br>Because he's never been high, the angel steals dope from her kid's stash box and teaches Mr. Whittier how to use a bong. They talk. Eat potato chips.<br><br>The angel, she says her husband has become his career. Her kids are growing away from her. Their family is falling apart.<br><br>Mr. W., he says his own folks, they couldn't cope. They have four other kids to raise. It's the only way they could afford the nursing home, by making him a ward of the court. After that, they'd show up and visit less and less.<br><br>And telling that, with some soft guitar ballad playing, Mr. W. will start to cry.<br><br>The one wish he wanted most was to love someone. To really make love. Not die a virgin.<br><br>Right then, the tears still rolling down from his stoner-red eyes, he'd say, “Please . . .”<br><br>This wrinkled old kid, he'd sniff and say, “Please, stop calling me Mister.”<br><br>The angel stroking his bald, spotted head, he'd tell her, “My name is Brandon.”<br><br>And he'd wait.<br><br>And she'd say it:<br><br>Brandon.<br><br>Of course, after that, they'd fuck.<br><br>Her, gentle and patient. The Madonna and the whore. Her long, yoga-trained legs spread to this naked, wrinkled goblin.<br><br>Her, the altar and the sacrifice.<br><br>Never as beautiful as she looked, next to his spotted, veined old skin. Never as powerful as she felt, as he drooled and trembled over her.<br><br>And, damn—for a virgin—if he didn't take his own sweet time. He'd started missionary-style, then had one of her legs in the air, splitting the reed. Then both her feet, gripped tight around the ankles and framing his panting face.<br><br>Thank God for the yoga.<br><br>Viagra-hard, he rode her on all fours, doggy-style, even taking himself out and poking at her ass until she said to stop. She was sore and stoned, and as he bent her legs to force her feet up, behind her head, by then her bright, fake angel's smile had come back.<br><br>After all that, he came. In her eyes. In her hair. He asked her for a cigarette she didn't have. Taking the bong off the floor beside the bed, he torched another bowl and didn't offer her a hit.<br><br>The angel, she got dressed and tucked her kid's bong under her coat. She knotted a scarf around her sticky hair and started to leave.<br><br>Behind her, as she opened the door to the hallway, Mr. Whittier was saying, “You know, I ain't ever had a blow job before, neither . . .”<br><br>As she stepped out of the room, he was laughing. Laughing.<br><br>After that, she'd be driving, and her cell phone would ring. It would be Whittier suggesting bondage, better drugs, blow jobs. And when the angel finally told him, “I can't . . .”<br><br>“Brandon . . .” he'd tell her. “The name's Brandon.”<br><br>Brandon, she'd say. She couldn't see him, not anymore.<br><br>It's then he'd tell her—he lied. About his age.<br><br>Over the phone, she'd say, “You don't have progeria?”<br><br>And Brandon Whittier would say, “I'm not eighteen years old.”<br><br>He wasn't eighteen, and he had the birth certificate to prove it. He was thirteen years old. Now a victim of statutory rape.<br><br>But, for enough cash money, he wouldn't squeal to the cops. Ten grand, and she wouldn't suffer through an ugly courtroom drama. Front-page headlines. All her lifetime of good works and investments reduced to nothing. All for a quick fuck with a little kid. Worse than nothing—her the pedophile, now a sex criminal who would need to register her whereabouts for the rest of her life. Maybe get divorced and lose her kids. Sex with a minor carried a mandatory five-year prison sentence.<br><br>On the other hand, in another year he'd be dead of old age. Ten grand was a small price to pay for the rest of her life.<br><br>Ten grand and maybe just one little knob job for old times' sake . . .<br><br>So of course she paid. They all paid. All the volunteers. The angels.<br><br>None of them ever went back to the old-folks' home, so they never met each other. To each angel, she was the only one. Really, there were a dozen or more.<br><br>And the money? It just kept piling up. Until Mr. Whittier was too old and tired and bored to just fuck.<br><br>“Look at the stains in the lobby carpet,” he said. “See how those stains have arms and legs?”<br><br>The same as the volunteer ladies, we were trapped by a boy in the body of an old man. A thirteen-year-old kid dying of old age. The part about his family abandoning him, that much was true. But Brandon Whittier was no longer dying ignored and alone.<br><br>And, the same way he'd bagged one angel after another, this wasn't his first experiment. We weren't his first batch of guinea pigs. And—until one of those stains came back to haunt him—he told us, we would not be his last.</p>

      <h3> PREVIEW:</h3>
      <p><br>Eleanor awakened to find the blue room gray and colorless in the morning rain. She found that she had thrown the quilt off during the night and had finished sleeping in her usual manner, with her head on the pillow. It was a surprise to find that she had slept until after eight, and she thought that it was ironic that the first good night’s sleep she had had in years had come to her in Hill House. Lying in the blue bed, looking up into the dim ceiling with its remote carved pattern, she asked herself, half asleep still, What did I do; did I make a fool of myself? Were they laughing at me?<br>Thinking quickly over the evening before, she could remember only that she had—must have—seemed foolishly, childishly contented, almost happy; had the others been amused to see that she was so simple? I said silly things, she told herself, and of course they noticed. Today I will be more reserved, less openly grateful to all of them for having me.<br>Then, awakening completely, she shook her head and sighed. You are a very silly baby, Eleanor, she told herself, as she did every morning.<br>The room came clearly alive around her; she was in the blue room at Hill House, the dimity curtains were moving slightly at the window, and the wild splashing in the bathroom must be Theodora, awake, sure to be dressed and ready first, certain to be hungry. “Good morning,” Eleanor called, and Theodora answering, gasping, “Good morning—through in a minute—I’ll leave the tub filled for you—are you starving? Because I am.” Does she think I wouldn’t bathe unless she left a full tub for me? Eleanor wondered, and then was ashamed; I came here to stop thinking things like that, she told herself sternly and rolled out of bed and went to the window. She looked out across the veranda roof to the wide lawn below, with its bushes and little clumps of trees wound around with mist. Far down at the end of the lawn was the line of trees which marked the path to the creek, although the prospect of a jolly picnic on the grass was not, this morning, so appealing. It was clearly going to be wet all day, but it was a summer rain, deepening the green of the grass and the trees, sweetening and cleaning the air. It’s charming, Eleanor thought, surprised at herself; she wondered if she was the first person ever to find Hill House charming and then thought, chilled, Or do they all think so, the first morning? She shivered, and found herself at the same time unable to account for the excitement she felt, which made it difficult to remember why it was so odd to wake up happy in Hill House.<br>“I’ll starve to death.” Theodora pounded on the bathroom door, and Eleanor snatched at her robe and hurried. “Try to look like a stray sunbeam,” Theodora called out from her room. “It’s such a dark day we’ve got to be a little brighter than usual.”<br>Sing before breakfast you’ll cry before night, Eleanor told herself, because she had been singing softly, “In delay there lies no plenty. . . .”<br>“I thought I was the lazy one,” Theodora said complacently through the door, “but you’re much, much worse. Lazy hardly begins to describe you. You must be clean enough now to come and have breakfast.”<br>“Mrs. Dudley sets out breakfast at nine. What will she think when we show up bright and smiling?”<br>“She will sob with disappointment. Did anyone scream for her in the night, do you suppose?”<br>Eleanor regarded a soapy leg critically. “I slept like a log,” she said.<br>“So did I. If you are not ready in three minutes I will come in and drown you. I want my breakfast.”<br>Eleanor was thinking that it had been a very long time since she had dressed to look like a stray sunbeam, or been so hungry for breakfast, or arisen so aware, so conscious of herself, so deliberate and tender in her attentions; she even brushed her teeth with a niceness she could not remember ever feeling before. It is all the result of a good night’s sleep, she thought; since Mother died I must have been sleeping even more poorly than I realized.<br>“Aren’t you ready yet?”<br>“Coming, coming,” Eleanor said, and ran to the door, remembered that it was still locked, and unlocked it softly. Theodora was waiting for her in the hall, vivid in the dullness in gaudy plaid; looking at Theodora, it was not possible for Eleanor to believe that she ever dressed or washed or moved or ate or slept or talked without enjoying every minute of what she was doing; perhaps Theodora never cared at all what other people thought of her.<br>“Do you realize that we may be another hour or so just finding the dining room?” Theodora said. “But maybe they have left us a map—did you know that Luke and the doctor have been up for hours? I was talking to them from the window.”<br>They have started without me, Eleanor thought; tomorrow I will wake up earlier and be there to talk from the window too. They came to the foot of the stairs, and Theodora crossed the great dark hall and put her hand confidently to a door. “Here,” she said, but the door opened into a dim, echoing room neither of them had seen before. “Here,” Eleanor said, but the door she chose led onto the narrow passage to the little parlor where last night they had sat before a fire.<br>“It’s across the hall from that,” Theodora said, and turned, baffled. “Damn it,” she said, and put her head back and shouted. “Luke? Doctor?”<br>Distantly they heard an answering shout, and Theodora moved to open another door. “If they think,” she said over her shoulder, “that they are going to keep me forever in this filthy hall, trying one door after another to get to my breakfast—”<br>“That’s the right one, I think,” Eleanor said, “with the dark room to go through, and then the dining room beyond.”<br>Theodora shouted again, blundered against some light piece of furniture, cursed, and then the door beyond was opened and the doctor said, “Good morning.”<br>“Foul, filthy house,” Theodora said, rubbing her knee. “Good morning.”<br>“You will never believe this now, of course,” the doctor said, “but three minutes ago these doors were wide open. We left them open so you could find your way. We sat here and watched them swing shut just before you called. Well. Good morning.”<br>“Kippers,” Luke said from the table. “Good morning. I hope you ladies are the kipper kind.”<br>They had come through the darkness of one night, they had met morning in Hill House, and they were a family, greeting one another with easy informality and going to the chairs they had used last night at dinner, their own places at the table.<br>“A fine big breakfast is what Mrs. Dudley certainly agreed to set out at nine,” Luke said, waving a fork. “We had begun to wonder if you were the coffee-and-a-roll-in-bed types.”<br>“We would have been here much sooner in any other house,” Theodora said.<br>“Did you really leave all the doors open for us?” Eleanor asked.<br>“That’s how we knew you were coming,” Luke told her. “We saw the doors swing shut.”<br>“Today we will nail all the doors open,” Theodora said. “I am going to pace this house until I can find food ten times out of ten. I slept with my light on all night,” she confided to the doctor, “but nothing happened at all.”<br>“It was all very quiet,” the doctor said.<br>“Did you watch over us all night?” Eleanor asked.<br>“Until about three, when Pamela finally put me to sleep. There wasn’t a sound until the rain started sometime after two. One of you ladies called out in her sleep once—”<br>“That must have been me,” Theodora said shamelessly. “Dreaming about the wicked sister at the gates of Hill House.”<br>“I dreamed about her too,” Eleanor said. She looked at the doctor and said suddenly, “It’s embarrassing. To think about being afraid, I mean.”<br>“We’re all in it together, you know,” Theodora said.<br>“It’s worse if you try not to show it,” the doctor said.<br>“Stuff yourself very full of kippers,” Luke said. “Then it will be impossible to feel anything at all.”<br>Eleanor felt, as she had the day before, that the conversation was being skillfully guided away from the thought of fear, so very present in her own mind. Perhaps she was to be allowed to speak occasionally for all of them so that, quieting her, they quieted themselves and could leave the subject behind them; perhaps, vehicle for every kind of fear, she contained enough for all. They are like children, she thought crossly, daring each other to go first, ready to turn and call names at whoever comes last; she pushed her plate away from her and sighed.<br>“Before I go to sleep tonight,” Theodora was saying to the doctor, “I want to be sure that I have seen every inch of this house. No more lying there wondering what is over my head or under me. And we have to open some windows and keep the doors open and stop feeling our way around.”<br>“Little signs,” Luke suggested. “Arrows pointing, reading THIS WAY OUT.”<br>“Or DEAD END,” Eleanor said.<br>“Or WATCH OUT FOR FALLING FURNITURE,” Theodora said. “We’ll make them,” she said to Luke.<br>“First we all explore the house,” Eleanor said, too quickly perhaps, because Theodora turned and looked at her curiously. “I don’t want to find myself left behind in an attic or something,” Eleanor added uncomfortably.<br>“No one wants to leave you behind anywhere,” Theodora said.<br>“Then I suggest,” Luke said, “that we first of all finish off the coffee in the pot, and then go nervously from room to room, endeavoring to discover some rational plan to this house, and leaving doors open as we go. I never thought,” he said, shaking his head sadly, “that I would stand to inherit a house where I had to put up signs to find my way around.”<br>“We need to find out what to call the rooms,” Theodora said. “Suppose I told you, Luke, that I would meet you clandestinely in the second-best drawing room—how would you ever know where to find me?”<br>“You could keep whistling till I got there,” Luke offered.<br>Theodora shuddered. “You would hear me whistling, and calling you, while you wandered from door to door, never opening the right one, and I would be inside, not able to find any way to get out—”<br>“And nothing to eat,” Eleanor said unkindly.<br>Theodora looked at her again. “And nothing to eat,” she agreed after a minute. Then, “It’s the crazy house at the carnival,” she said. “Rooms opening out of each other and doors going everywhere at once and swinging shut when you come, and I bet that somewhere there are mirrors that make you look all sideways and an air hose to blow up your skirts, and something that comes out of a dark passage and laughs in your face—” She was suddenly quiet and picked up her cup so quickly that her coffee spilled.<br>“Not as bad as all that,” the doctor said easily. “Actually, the ground floor is laid out in what I might almost call concentric circles of rooms; at the center is the little parlor where we sat last night; around it, roughly, are a series of rooms—the billiard room, for instance, and a dismal little den entirely furnished in rose-colored satin—”<br>“Where Eleanor and I will go each morning with our needlework.”<br>“—and surrounding these—I call them the inside rooms because they are the ones with no direct way to the outside; they have no windows, you remember—surrounding these are the ring of outside rooms, the drawing room, the library, the conservatory, the—”<br>“No,” Theodora said, shaking her head. “I am still lost back in the rose-colored satin.”<br>“And the veranda goes all around the house. There are doors opening onto the veranda from the drawing room, and the conservatory, and one sitting room. There is also a passage—”<br>“Stop, stop.” Theodora was laughing, but she shook her head. “It’s a filthy, rotten house.”<br>The swinging door in the corner of the dining room opened, and Mrs. Dudley stood, one hand holding the door open, looking without expression at the breakfast table. “I clear off at ten,” Mrs. Dudley said.<br>“Good morning, Mrs. Dudley,” Luke said.<br>Mrs. Dudley turned her eyes to him. “I clear off at ten,” she said. “The dishes are supposed to be back on the shelves. I take them out again for lunch. I set out lunch at one, but first the dishes have to be back on the shelves.”<br>“Of course, Mrs. Dudley.” The doctor rose and put down his napkin. “Everybody ready?” he asked.<br>Under Mrs. Dudley’s eye Theodora deliberately lifted her cup and finished the last of her coffee, then touched her mouth with her napkin and sat back. “Splendid breakfast,” she said conversationally. “Do the dishes belong to the house?”<br>“They belong on the shelves,” Mrs. Dudley said.<br>“And the glassware and the silver and the linen? Lovely old things.”<br>“The linen,” Mrs. Dudley said, “belongs in the linen drawers in the dining room. The silver belongs in the silver chest. The glasses belong on the shelves.”<br>“We must be quite a bother to you,” Theodora said.<br>Mrs. Dudley was silent. Finally she said, “I clear up at ten. I set out lunch at one.”<br>Theodora laughed and rose. “On,” she said, “on, on. Let us go and open doors.”<br>They began reasonably enough with the dining-room door, which they propped open with a heavy chair. The room beyond was the game room; the table against which Theodora had stumbled was a low inlaid chess table (“Now, I could not have overlooked that last night,” the doctor said irritably), and at one end of the room were card tables and chairs, and a tall cabinet where the chessmen had been, with croquet balls and the cribbage board.<br>“Jolly spot to spend a carefree hour,” Luke said, standing in the doorway regarding the bleak room. The cold greens of the table tops were reflected unhappily in the dark tiles around the fireplace; the inevitable wood paneling was, here, not at all enlivened by a series of sporting prints which seemed entirely devoted to various methods of doing wild animals to death, and over the mantel a deer-head looked down upon them in patent embarrassment.<br>“This is where they came to enjoy themselves,” Theodora said, and her voice echoed shakily from the high ceiling. “They came here,” she explained, “to relax from the oppressive atmosphere of the rest of the house.” The deer-head looked down on her mournfully. “Those two little girls,” she said. “Can we please take down that beast up there?”<br>“I think it’s taken a fancy to you,” Luke said. “It’s never taken its eyes off you since you came in. Let’s get out of here.”<br>They propped the door open as they left, and came out into the hall, which shone dully under the light from the open rooms. “When we find a room with a window,” the doctor remarked, “we will open it; until then, let us be content with opening the front door.”<br>“You keep thinking of the little children,” Eleanor said to Theodora, “but I can’t forget that lonely little companion, walking around these rooms, wondering who else was in the house.”<br>Luke tugged the great front door open and wheeled the big vase to hold it; “Fresh air,” he said thankfully. The warm smell of rain and wet grass swept into the hall, and for a minute they stood in the open doorway, breathing air from outside Hill House. Then the doctor said, “Now here is something none of you anticipated,” and he opened a small door tucked in beside the tall front door and stood back, smiling. “The library,” he said. “In the tower.”<br>“I can’t go in there,” Eleanor said, surprising herself, but she could not. She backed away, overwhelmed with the cold air of mold and earth which rushed at her. “My mother—” she said, not knowing what she wanted to tell them, and pressed herself against the wall.<br>“Indeed?” said the doctor, regarding her with interest. “Theodora?” Theodora shrugged and stepped into the library; Eleanor shivered. “Luke?” said the doctor, but Luke was already inside. From where she stood Eleanor could see only a part of the circular wall of the library, with a narrow iron staircase going up and perhaps, since it was the tower, up and up and up; Eleanor shut her eyes, hearing the doctor’s voice distantly, hollow against the stone of the library walls.<br>“Can you see the little trapdoor up there in the shadows?” he was asking. “It leads out onto a little balcony, and of course that’s where she is commonly supposed to have hanged herself—the girl, you remember. A most suitable spot, certainly; more suitable for suicides, I would think, than for books. She is supposed to have tied the rope onto the iron railing and then just stepped—”<br>“Thanks,” Theodora said from within. “I can visualize it perfectly, thank you. For myself, I would probably have anchored the rope onto the deer head in the game room, but I suppose she had some sentimental attachment to the tower; what a nice word ‘attachment’ is in that context, don’t you think?”<br>“Delicious.” It was Luke’s voice, louder; they were coming out of the library and back to the hall where Eleanor waited. “I think that I will make this room into a night club. I will put the orchestra up there on the balcony, and dancing girls will come down that winding iron staircase; the bar—”<br>“Eleanor,” Theodora said, “are you all right now? It’s a perfectly awful room, and you were right to stay out of it.”<br>Eleanor stood away from the wall; her hands were cold and she wanted to cry, but she turned her back to the library door, which the doctor propped open with a stack of books. “I don’t think I’ll do much reading while I’m here,” she said, trying to speak lightly. “Not if the books smell like the library.”<br>“I hadn’t noticed a smell,” the doctor said. He looked inquiringly at Luke, who shook his head. “Odd,” the doctor went on, “and just the kind of thing we’re looking for. Make a note of it, my dear, and try to describe it exactly.”<br>Theodora was puzzled. She stood in the hallway, turning, looking back of her at the staircase and then around again at the front door. “Are there two front doors?” she asked. “Am I just mixed up?”<br>The doctor smiled happily; he had clearly been hoping for some such question. “This is the only front door,” he said. “It is the one you came in yesterday.”<br>Theodora frowned. “Then why can’t Eleanor and I see the tower from our bedroom windows? Our rooms look out over the front of the house, and yet—”<br>The doctor laughed and clapped his hands. “At last,” he said. “Clever Theodora. This is why I wanted you to see the house by day. Come, sit on the stairs while I tell you.”<br>Obediently they settled on the stairs, looking up at the doctor, who took on his lecturing stance and began formally, “One of the peculiar traits of Hill House is its design—”<br>“Crazy house at the carnival.”<br>“Precisely. Have you not wondered at our extreme difficulty in finding our way around? An ordinary house would not have had the four of us in such confusion for so long, and yet time after time we choose the wrong doors, the room we want eludes us. Even I have had my troubles.” He sighed and nodded. “I daresay,” he went on, “that old Hugh Crain expected that someday Hill House might become a showplace, like the Winchester House in California or the many octagon houses; he designed Hill House himself, remember, and, I have told you before, he was a strange man. Every angle”—and the doctor gestured toward the doorway—“every angle is slightly wrong. Hugh Crain must have detested other people and their sensible squared-away houses, because he made his house to suit his mind. Angles which you assume are the right angles you are accustomed to, and have every right to expect are true, are actually a fraction of a degree off in one direction or another. I am sure, for instance, that you believe that the stairs you are sitting on are level, because you are not prepared for stairs which are not level—”<br>They moved uneasily, and Theodora put out a quick hand to take hold of the balustrade, as though she felt she might be falling.<br>“—are actually on a very slight slant toward the central shaft; the doorways are all a very little bit off center—that may be, by the way, the reason the doors swing shut unless they are held; I wondered this morning whether the approaching footsteps of you two ladies upset the delicate balance of the doors. Of course the result of all these tiny aberrations of measurement adds up to a fairly large distortion in the house as a whole. Theodora cannot see the tower from her bedroom window because the tower actually stands at the corner of the house. From Theodora’s bedroom window it is completely invisible, although from here it seems to be directly outside her room. The window of Theodora’s room is actually fifteen feet to the left of where we are now.”<br>Theodora spread her hands helplessly. “Golly,” she said.<br>“I see,” Eleanor said. “The veranda roof is what misleads us. I can look out my window and see the veranda roof and because I came directly into the house and up the stairs I assumed that the front door was right below, although really—”<br>“You see only the veranda roof,” the doctor said. “The front door is far away; it and the tower are visible from the nursery, which is the big room at the end of the hallway; we will see it later today. It is”—and his voice was saddened—“a masterpiece of architectural misdirection. The double stairway at Chambord—”<br>“Then everything is a little bit off center?” Theodora asked uncertainly. “That’s why it all feels so disjointed?”<br>“What happens when you go back to a real house?” Eleanor asked. “I mean—a—well—a real house?”<br>“It must be like coming off shipboard,” Luke said. “After being here for a while your sense of balance could be so distorted that it would take you a while to lose your sea legs, or your Hill House legs. Could it be,” he asked the doctor, “that what people have been assuming were supernatural manifestations were really only the result of a slight loss of balance in the people who live here? The inner ear,” he told Theodora wisely.<br>“It must certainly affect people in some way,” the doctor said. “We have grown to trust blindly in our senses of balance and reason, and I can see where the mind might fight wildly to preserve its own familiar stable patterns against all evidence that it was leaning sideways.” He turned away. “We have marvels still before us,” he said, and they came down from the stairway and followed him, walking gingerly, testing the floors as they moved. They went down the narrow passage to the little parlor where they had sat the night before, and from there, leaving doors propped open behind them, they moved into the outer circle of rooms, which looked out onto the veranda. They pulled heavy draperies away from windows and the light from outside came into Hill House. They passed through a music room where a harp stood sternly apart from them, with never a jangle of strings to mark their footfalls. A grand piano stood tightly shut, with a candelabra above, no candle ever touched by flame. A marble-topped table held wax flowers under glass, and the chairs were twig-thin and gilded. Beyond this was the conservatory, with tall glass doors showing them the rain outside, and ferns growing damply around and over wicker furniture. Here it was uncomfortably moist, and they left it quickly, to come through an arched doorway into the drawing room and stand, aghast and incredulous.<br>“It’s not there,” Theodora said, weak and laughing. “I don’t believe it’s there.” She shook her head. “Eleanor, do you see it too?”<br>“How . . . ?” Eleanor said helplessly.<br>“I thought you would be pleased.” The doctor was complacent.<br>One entire end of the drawing room was in possession of a marble statuary piece; against the mauve stripes and flowered carpet it was huge and grotesque and somehow whitely naked; Eleanor put her hands over her eyes, and Theodora clung to her. “I thought it might be intended for Venus rising from the waves,” the doctor said.<br>“Not at all,” said Luke, finding his voice, “it’s Saint Francis curing the lepers.”<br>“No, no,” Eleanor said. “One of them is a dragon.”<br>“It’s none of that,” said Theodora roundly; “it’s a family portrait, you sillies. Composite. Anyone would know it at once; that figure in the center, that tall, undraped—good heavens!—masculine one, that’s old Hugh, patting himself on the back because he built Hill House, and his two attendant nymphs are his daughters. The one on the right who seems to be brandishing an ear of corn is actually telling about her lawsuit, and the other one, the little one on the end, is the companion, and the one on the other end—”<br>“Is Mrs. Dudley, done from life,” Luke said.<br>“And that grass stuff they’re all standing on is really supposed to be the dining-room carpet, grown up a little. Did anyone else notice that dining-room carpet? It looks like a field of hay, and you can feel it tickling your ankles. In back, that kind of overspreading apple-tree kind of thing, that’s—”<br>“A symbol of the protection of the house, surely,” Dr. Montague said.<br>“I’d hate to think it might fall on us,” Eleanor said. “Since the house is so unbalanced, Doctor, isn’t there some chance of that?”<br>“I have read that the statue was carefully, and at great expense, constructed to offset the uncertainty of the floor on which it stands. It was put in, at any rate, when the house was built, and it has not fallen yet. It is possible, you know, that Hugh Crain admired it, even found it lovely.”<br>“It is also possible that he used it to scare his children with,” Theodora said. “What a pretty room this would be without it.” She turned, swinging. “A dancing room,” she said, “for ladies in full skirts, and room enough for a full country dance. Hugh Crain, will you take a turn with me?” and she curtsied to the statue.<br>“I believe he’s going to accept,” Eleanor said, taking an involuntary step backward.<br>“Don’t let him tread on your toes,” the doctor said, and laughed. “Remember what happened to Don Juan.”<br>Theodora touched the statue timidly, putting her finger against the outstretched hand of one of the figures. “Marble is always a shock,” she said. “It never feels like you think it’s going to. I suppose a lifesize statue looks enough like a real person to make you expect to feel skin.” Then, turning again, and shimmering in the dim room, she waltzed alone, turning to bow to the statue.<br>“At the end of the room,” the doctor said to Eleanor and Luke, “under those draperies, are doors leading onto the veranda; when Theodora is heated from dancing she may step out into the cooler air.” He went the length of the room to pull aside the heavy blue draperies and opened the doors. Again the smell of the warm rain came in, and a burst of wind, so that a little breath seemed to move across the statue, and light touched the colored walls.<br>“Nothing in this house moves,” Eleanor said, “until you look away, and then you just catch something from the corner of your eye. Look at the little figurines on the shelves; when we all had our backs turned they were dancing with Theodora.”<br>“I move,” Theodora said, circling toward them.<br>“Flowers under glass,” Luke said. “Tassels. I am beginning to fancy this house.”<br>Theodora pulled at Eleanor’s hair. “Race you around the veranda,” she said and darted for the doors. Eleanor, with no time for hesitation or thought, followed, and they ran out onto the veranda. Eleanor, running and laughing, came around a curve of the veranda to find Theodora going in another door, and stopped, breathless. They had come to the kitchen, and Mrs. Dudley, turning away from the sink, watched them silently.<br>“Mrs. Dudley,” Theodora said politely, “we’ve been exploring the house.”<br>Mrs. Dudley’s eyes moved to the clock on the shelf over the stove. “It is half-past eleven,” she said. “I—”<br>“—set lunch on at one,” Theodora said. “We’d like to look over the kitchen, if we may. We’ve seen all the other downstairs rooms, I think.”<br>Mrs. Dudley was still for a minute and then, moving her head acquiescently, turned and walked deliberately across the kitchen to a farther doorway. When she opened it they could see the back stairs beyond, and Mrs. Dudley turned and closed the door behind her before she started up. Theodora cocked her head at the doorway and waited a minute before she said, “I wonder if Mrs. Dudley has a soft spot in her heart for me, I really do.”<br>“I suppose she’s gone up to hang herself from the turret,” Eleanor said. “Let’s see what’s for lunch while we’re here.”<br>“Don’t joggle anything,” Theodora said. “You know perfectly well that the dishes belong on the shelves. Do you think that woman really means to make us a soufflé? Here is certainly a soufflé dish, and eggs and cheese—”<br>“It’s a nice kitchen,” Eleanor said. “In my mother’s house the kitchen was dark and narrow, and nothing you cooked there ever had any taste or color.”<br>“What about your own kitchen?” Theodora asked absently. “In your little apartment? Eleanor, look at the doors.”<br>“I can’t make a soufflé,” Eleanor said.<br>“Look, Eleanor. There’s the door onto the veranda, and another that opens onto steps going down—to the cellar, I guess—and another over there going onto the veranda again, and the one she used to go upstairs, and another one over there—”<br>“To the veranda again,” Eleanor said, opening it. “Three doors going out onto the veranda from one kitchen.”<br>“And the door to the butler’s pantry and on into the dining room. Our good Mrs. Dudley likes doors, doesn’t she? She can certainly”—and their eyes met—“get out fast in any direction if she wants to.”<br>Eleanor turned abruptly and went back to the veranda. “I wonder if she had Dudley cut extra doors for her. I wonder how she likes working in a kitchen where a door in back of her might open without her knowing it. I wonder, actually, just what Mrs. Dudley is in the habit of meeting in her kitchen so that she wants to make sure that she’ll find a way out no matter which direction she runs. I wonder—”<br>“Shut up,” Theodora said amiably. “A nervous cook can’t make a good soufflé, anyone knows that, and she’s probably listening on the stairs. Let us choose one of her doors and leave it open behind us.”<br>Luke and the doctor were standing on the veranda, looking out over the lawn; the front door was oddly close, beyond them. Behind the house, seeming almost overhead, the great hills were muted and dull in the rain. Eleanor wandered along the veranda, thinking that she had never before known a house so completely surrounded. Like a very tight belt, she thought; would the house fly apart if the veranda came off? She went what she thought must be the great part of the circle around the house, and then she saw the tower. It rose up before her suddenly, almost without warning, as she came around the curve of the veranda. It was made of gray stone, grotesquely solid, jammed hard against the wooden side of the house, with the insistent veranda holding it there. Hideous, she thought, and then thought that if the house burned away someday the tower would still stand, gray and forbidding over the ruins, warning people away from what was left of Hill House, with perhaps a stone fallen here and there, so owls and bats might fly in and out and nest among the books below. Halfway up windows began, thin angled slits in the stone, and she wondered what it would be like, looking down from them, and wondered that she had not been able to enter the tower. I will never look down from those windows, she thought, and tried to imagine the narrow iron stairway going up and around inside. High on top was a conical wooden roof, topped by a wooden spire. It must have been laughable in any other house, but here in Hill House it belonged, gleeful and expectant, awaiting perhaps a slight creature creeping out from the little window onto the slanted roof, reaching up to the spire, knotting a rope. . . .<br>“You’ll fall,” Luke said, and Eleanor gasped; she brought her eyes down with an effort and found that she was griping the veranda rail tightly and leaning far backward. “Don’t trust your balance in my charming Hill House,” Luke said, and Eleanor breathed deeply, dizzy, and staggered. He caught her and held her while she tried to steady herself in the rocking world where the trees and the lawn seemed somehow tilted sideways and the sky turned and swung.<br>“Eleanor?” Theodora said nearby, and she heard the sound of the doctor’s feet running along the veranda. “This damnable house,” Luke said. “You have to watch it every minute.”<br>“Eleanor?” said the doctor.<br>“I’m all right,” Eleanor said, shaking her head and standing unsteadily by herself. “I was leaning back to see the top of the tower and I got dizzy.”<br>“She was standing almost sideways when I caught her,” Luke said.<br>“I’ve had that feeling once or twice this morning,” Theodora said, “as though I was walking up the wall.”<br>“Bring her back inside,” the doctor said. “It’s not so bad when you’re inside the house.”<br>“I’m really all right,” Eleanor said, very much embarrassed, and she walked with deliberate steps along the veranda to the front door, which was closed. “I thought we left it open,” she said with a little shake in her voice, and the doctor came past her and pushed the heavy door open again. Inside, the hall had returned to itself; all the doors they had left open were neatly closed. When the doctor opened the door into the game room they could see beyond him that the doors to the dining room were closed, and the little stool they had used to prop one door open was neatly back in place against the wall. In the boudoir and the drawing room, the parlor and the conservatory, the doors and windows were closed, the draperies pulled together, and the darkness back again.<br>“It’s Mrs. Dudley,” Theodora said, trailing after the doctor and Luke, who moved quickly from one room to the next, pushing doors wide open again and propping them, sweeping drapes away from windows and letting in the warm, wet air. “Mrs. Dudley did it yesterday, as soon as Eleanor and I were out of the way, because she’d rather shut them herself than come along and find them shut by themselves because the doors belong shut and the windows belong shut and the dishes belong—” She began to laugh foolishly, and the doctor turned and frowned at her with irritation.<br>“Mrs. Dudley had better learn her place,” he said. “I will nail these doors open if I have to.” He turned down the passageway to their little parlor and sent the door swinging open with a crash. “Losing my temper will not help,” he said, and gave the door a vicious kick.<br>“Sherry in the parlor before lunch,” Luke said amiably. “Ladies, enter.”<br>2<br>“Mrs. Dudley,” the doctor said, putting down his fork, “an admirable soufflé.”<br>Mrs. Dudley turned to regard him briefly and went into the kitchen with an empty dish.<br>The doctor sighed and moved his shoulders tiredly. “After my vigil last night, I feel the need of a rest this afternoon, and you,” he said to Eleanor, “would do well to lie down for an hour. Perhaps a regular afternoon rest might be more comfortable for all of us.”<br>“I see,” said Theodora, amused. “I must take an afternoon nap. It may look funny when I go home again, but I can always tell them that it was part of my schedule at Hill House.”<br>“Perhaps we will have trouble sleeping at night,” the doctor said, and a little chill went around the table, darkening the light of the silver and the bright colors of the china, a little cloud that drifted through the dining room and brought Mrs. Dudley after it.<br>“It’s five minutes of two,” Mrs. Dudley said.<br>3<br>Eleanor did not sleep during the afternoon, although she would have liked to; instead, she lay on Theodora’s bed in the green room and watched Theodora do her nails, chatting lazily, unwilling to let herself perceive that she had followed Theodora into the green room because she had not dared to be alone.<br>“I love decorating myself,” Theodora said, regarding her hand affectionately. “I’d like to paint myself all over.”<br>Eleanor moved comfortably. “Gold paint,” she suggested, hardly thinking. With her eyes almost closed she could see Theodora only as a mass of color sitting on the floor.<br>“Nail polish and perfume and bath salts,” Theodora said, as one telling the cities of the Nile. “Mascara. You don’t think half enough of such things, Eleanor.”<br>Eleanor laughed and closed her eyes altogether. “No time,” she said.<br>“Well,” Theodora said with determination, “by the time I’m through with you, you will be a different person; I dislike being with women of no color.” She laughed to show that she was teasing, and then went on, “I think I will put red polish on your toes.”<br>Eleanor laughed too and held out her bare foot. After a minute, nearly asleep, she felt the odd cold little touch of the brush on her toes, and shivered.<br>“Surely a famous courtesan like yourself is accustomed to the ministrations of handmaidens,” Theodora said. “Your feet are dirty.”<br>Shocked, Eleanor sat up and looked; her feet were dirty, and her nails were painted bright red. “It’s horrible,” she said to Theodora, “it’s wicked,” wanting to cry. Then, helplessly, she began to laugh at the look on Theodora’s face. “I’ll go and wash my feet,” she said.<br>“Golly.” Theodora sat on the floor beside the bed, staring. “Look,” she said. “My feet are dirty, too, baby, honest. Look.”<br>“Anyway,” Eleanor said, “I hate having things done to me.”<br>“You’re about as crazy as anyone I ever saw,” Theodora said cheerfully.<br>“I don’t like to feel helpless,” Eleanor said. “My mother—”<br>“Your mother would have been delighted to see you with your toenails painted red,” Theodora said. “They look nice.”<br>Eleanor looked at her feet again. “It’s wicked,” she said inadequately. “I mean—on my feet. It makes me feel like I look like a fool.”<br>“You’ve got foolishness and wickedness somehow mixed up.” Theodora began to gather her equipment together. “Anyway, I won’t take it off and we’ll both watch to see whether Luke and the doctor look at your feet first.”<br>“No matter what I try to say, you make it sound foolish,” Eleanor said.<br>“Or wicked.” Theodora looked up at her gravely. “I have a hunch,” she said, “that you ought to go home, Eleanor.”<br>Is she laughing at me? Eleanor wondered; has she decided that I am not fit to stay? “I don’t want to go,” she said, and Theodora looked at her again quickly and then away, and touched Eleanor’s toes softly. “The polish is dry,” she said. “I’m an idiot. Just something frightened me for a minute.” She stood up and stretched. “Let’s go look for the others,” she said.<br>4<br>Luke leaned himself wearily against the wall of the upstairs hall, his head resting against the gold frame of an engraving of a ruin. “I keep thinking of this house as my own future property,” he said, “more now than I did before; I keep telling myself that it will belong to me someday, and I keep asking myself why.” He gestured at the length of the hall. “If I had a passion for doors,” he said, “or gilded clocks, or miniatures; if I wanted a Turkish corner of my own, I would very likely regard Hill House as a fairyland of beauty.”<br>“It’s a handsome house,” the doctor said stanchly. “It must have been thought of as elegant when it was built.” He started off down the hall, to the large room on the end which had once been the nursery. “Now,” he said, “we shall see the tower from a window”—and shivered as he passed through the door. Then he turned and looked back curiously. “Could there be a draft across that doorway?”<br>“A draft? In Hill House?” Theodora laughed. “Not unless you could manage to make one of those doors stay open.”<br>“Come here one at a time, then,” the doctor said, and Theodora moved forward, grimacing as she passed the doorway.<br>“Like the doorway of a tomb,” she said. “It’s warm enough inside, though.”<br>Luke came, hesitated in the cold spot, and then moved quickly to get out of it, and Eleanor, following, felt with incredulity the piercing cold that struck her between one step and the next; it was like passing through a wall of ice, she thought, and asked the doctor, “What is it?”<br>The doctor was patting his hands together with delight. “You can keep your Turkish corners, my boy,” he said. He reached out a hand and held it carefully over the location of the cold. “They cannot explain this,” he said. “The very essence of the tomb, as Theodora points out. The cold spot in Borley Rectory only dropped eleven degrees,” he went on complacently. “This, I should think, is considerably colder. The heart of the house.”<br>Theodora and Eleanor had moved to stand closer together; although the nursery was warm, it smelled musty and close, and the cold crossing the doorway was almost tangible, visible as a barrier which must be crossed in order to get out. Beyond the windows the gray stone of the tower pressed close; inside, the room was dark and the line of nursery animals painted along the wall seemed somehow not at all jolly, but as though they were trapped, or related to the dying deer in the sporting prints of the game room. The nursery, larger than the other bedrooms, had an indefinable air of neglect found nowhere else in Hill House, and it crossed Eleanor’s mind that even Mrs. Dudley’s diligent care might not bring her across that cold barrier any oftener than necessary.<br>Luke had stepped back across the cold spot and was examining the hall carpet, then the walls, patting at the surfaces as though hoping to discover some cause for the odd cold. “It couldn’t be a draft,” he said, looking up at the doctor. “Unless they’ve got a direct air line to the North Pole. Everything’s solid, anyway.”<br>“I wonder who slept in the nursery,” the doctor said irrelevantly. “Do you suppose they shut it up, once the children were gone?”<br>“Look,” Luke said, pointing. In either corner of the hall, over the nursery doorway, two grinning heads were set; meant, apparently, as gay decorations for the nursery entrance, they were no more jolly or carefree than the animals inside. Their separate stares, captured forever in distorted laughter, met and locked at the point of the hall where the vicious cold centered. “When you stand where they can look at you,” Luke explained, “they freeze you.”<br>Curiously, the doctor stepped down the hall to join him, looking up. “Don’t leave us alone in here,” Theodora said, and ran out of the nursery, pulling Eleanor through the cold, which was like a fast slap, or a close cold breath. “A fine place to chill our beer,” she said, and put out her tongue at the grinning faces.<br>“I must make a full account of this,” the doctor said happily.<br>“It doesn’t seem like an impartial cold,” Eleanor said, awkward because she was not quite sure what she meant. “I felt it as deliberate, as though something wanted to give me an unpleasant shock.”<br>“It’s because of the faces, I suppose,” the doctor said; he was on his hands and knees, feeling along the floor. “Measuring tape and thermometer,” he told himself, “chalk for an outline; perhaps the cold intensifies at night? Everything is worse,” he said, looking at Eleanor, “if you think something is looking at you.”<br>Luke stepped through the cold, with a shiver, and closed the door to the nursery; he came back to the others in the hall with a kind of leap, as though he thought he could escape the cold by not touching the floor. With the nursery door closed they realized all at once how much darker it had become, and Theodora said restlessly, “Let’s get downstairs to our parlor; I can feel those hills pushing in.”<br>“After five,” Luke said. “Cocktail time. I suppose,” he said to the doctor, “you will trust me to mix you a cocktail again tonight?”<br>“Too much vermouth,” the doctor said, and followed them lingeringly, watching the nursery door over his shoulder.<br>5<br>“I propose,” the doctor said, setting down his napkin, “that we take our coffee in our little parlor. I find that fire very cheerful.”<br>Theodora giggled. “Mrs. Dudley’s gone, so let’s race around fast and get all those doors and windows open and take everything down from the shelves—”<br>“The house seems different when she’s not in it,” Eleanor said.<br>“Emptier.” Luke looked at her and nodded; he was arranging the coffee cups on a tray, and the doctor had already gone on, doggedly opening doors and propping them. “Each night I realize suddenly that we four are alone here.”<br>“Although Mrs. Dudley’s not much good as far as company is concerned; it’s funny,” Eleanor said, looking down at the dinner table, “I dislike Mrs. Dudley as much as any of you, but my mother would never let me get up and leave a table looking like this until morning.”<br>“If she wants to leave before dark she has to clear away in the morning,” Theodora said without interest. “I’m certainly not going to do it.”<br>“It’s not nice to walk away and leave a dirty table.”<br>“You couldn’t get them back on the right shelves anyway, and she’d have to do it all over again just to get your fingermarks off things.”<br>“If I just took the silverware and let it soak—”<br>“No,” Theodora said, catching her hand. “Do you want to go out into that kitchen all alone, with all those doors?”<br>“No,” Eleanor said, setting down the handful of forks she had gathered. “I guess I don’t, really.” She lingered to look uneasily at the table, at the crumpled napkins and the drop of wine spilled by Luke’s place, and shook her head. “I don’t know what my mother would say, though.”<br>“Come on,” Theodora said. “They’ve left lights for us.”<br>The fire in the little parlor was bright, and Theodora sat down beside the coffee tray while Luke brought brandy from the cupboard where he had carefully set it away the night before. “We must be cheerful at all costs,” he said. “I’ll challenge you again tonight, Doctor.”<br>Before dinner they had ransacked the other downstairs rooms for comfortable chairs and lamps, and now their little parlor was easily the pleasantest room in the house. “Hill House has really been very kind to us,” Theodora said, giving Eleanor her coffee, and Eleanor sat down gratefully in a pillowy, overstuffed chair. “No dirty dishes for Eleanor to wash, a pleasant evening in good company, and perhaps the sun shining again tomorrow.”<br>“We must plan our picnic,” Eleanor said.<br>“I am going to get fat and lazy in Hill House,” Theodora went on. Her insistence on naming Hill House troubled Eleanor. It’s as though she were saying it deliberately, Eleanor thought, telling the house she knows its name, calling the house to tell it where we are; is it bravado? “Hill House, Hill House, Hill House,” Theodora said softly, and smiled across at Eleanor.<br>“Tell me,” Luke said politely to Theodora, “since you are a princess, tell me about the political situation in your country.”<br>“Very unsettled,” Theodora said. “I ran away because my father, who is of course the king, insists that I marry Black Michael, who is the pretender to the throne. I, of course, cannot endure the sight of Black Michael, who wears one gold earring and beats his grooms with a riding crop.”<br>“A most unstable country,” Luke said. “How did you ever manage to get away?”<br>“I fled in a hay wagon, disguised as a milkmaid. They never thought to look for me there, and I crossed the border with papers I forged myself in a woodcutter’s hut.”<br>“And Black Michael will no doubt take over the country now in a coup d’état?”<br>“Undoubtedly. And he can have it.”<br>It’s like waiting in a dentist’s office, Eleanor thought, watching them over her coffee cup; waiting in a dentist’s office and listening to other patients make brave jokes across the room, all of you certain to meet the dentist sooner or later. She looked up suddenly, aware of the doctor near her, and smiled uncertainly.<br>“Nervous?” the doctor asked, and Eleanor nodded.<br>“Only because I wonder what’s going to happen,” she said.<br>“So do I.” The doctor moved a chair and sat down beside her. “You have the feeling that something—whatever it is—is going to happen soon?”<br>“Yes. Everything seems to be waiting.”<br>“And they”—the doctor nodded at Theodora and Luke, who were laughing at each other—“they meet it in their way; I wonder what it will do to all of us. I would have said a month ago that a situation like this would never really come about, that we four would sit here together, in this house.” He does not name it, Eleanor noticed. “I’ve been waiting for a long time,” he said.<br>“You think we are right to stay?”<br>“Right?” he said. “I think we are all incredibly silly to stay. I think that an atmosphere like this one can find out the flaws and faults and weaknesses in all of us, and break us apart in a matter of days. We have only one defense, and that is running away. At least it can’t follow us, can it? When we feel ourselves endangered we can leave, just as we came. And,” he added dryly, “just as fast as we can go.”<br>“But we are forewarned,” Eleanor said, “and there are four of us together.”<br>“I have already mentioned this to Luke and Theodora,” he said. “Promise me absolutely that you will leave, as fast as you can, if you begin to feel the house catching at you.”<br>“I promise,” Eleanor said, smiling. He is trying to make me feel braver, she thought, and was grateful. “It’s all right, though,” she told him. “Really, it’s all right.”<br>“I will feel no hesitation about sending you away,” he said, rising, “if it seems to be necessary. Luke?” he said. “Will the ladies excuse us?”<br>While they set up the chessboard and men Theodora wandered, cup in hand, around the room, and Eleanor thought, She moves like an animal, nervous and alert; she can’t sit still while there is any scent of disturbance in the air; we are all uneasy. “Come and sit by me,” she said, and Theodora came, moving with grace, circling to a resting spot. She sat down in the chair the doctor had left, and leaned her head back tiredly; how lovely she is, Eleanor thought, how thoughtlessly, luckily lovely. “Are you tired?”<br>Theodora turned her head, smiling. “I can’t stand waiting much longer.”<br>“I was just thinking how relaxed you looked.”<br>“And I was just thinking of—when was it? day before yesterday?—and wondering how I could have brought myself to leave there and come here. Possibly I’m homesick.”<br>“Already?”<br>“Did you ever think about being homesick? If your home was Hill House would you be homesick for it? Did those two little girls cry for their dark, grim house when they were taken away?”<br>“I’ve never been away from anywhere,” Eleanor said carefully, “so I suppose I’ve never been homesick.”<br>“How about now? Your little apartment?”<br>“Perhaps,” Eleanor said, looking into the fire, “I haven’t had it long enough to believe it’s my own.”<br>“I want my own bed,” Theodora said, and Eleanor thought, She is sulking again; when she is hungry or tired or bored she turns into a baby. “I’m sleepy,” Theodora said.<br>“It’s after eleven,” Eleanor said, and as she turned to glance at the chess game the doctor shouted with joyful triumph, and Luke laughed.<br>“Now, sir,” the doctor said. “Now, sir.”<br>“Fairly beaten, I admit,” Luke said. He began to gather the chessmen and set them back into their box. “Any reason why I can’t take a drop of brandy upstairs with me? To put myself to sleep, or give myself Dutch courage, or some such reason. Actually”—and he smiled over at Theodora and Eleanor—“I plan to stay up and read for a while.”<br>“Are you still reading Pamela?” Eleanor asked the doctor.<br>“Volume two. I have three volumes to go, and then I shall begin Clarissa Harlowe, I think. Perhaps Luke would care to borrow—”<br>“No, thanks,” Luke said hastily. “I have a suitcase full of mystery stories.”<br>The doctor turned to look around. “Let me see,” he said, “fire screened, lights out. Leave the doors for Mrs. Dudley to close in the morning.”<br>Tiredly, following one another, they went up the great stairway, turning out lights behind them. “Has everyone got a flashlight, by the way?” the doctor asked, and they nodded, more intent upon sleep than the waves of darkness which came after them up the stairs of Hill House.<br>“Good night, everyone,” Eleanor said, opening the door to the blue room.<br>“Good night,” Luke said.<br>“Good night,” Theodora said.<br>“Good night,” the doctor said. “Sleep tight.”<br>6<br>“Coming, mother, coming,” Eleanor said, fumbling for the light. “It’s all right, I’m coming.” Eleanor, she heard, Eleanor. “Coming, coming,” she shouted irritably, “just a minute, I’m coming.”<br>“Eleanor?”<br>Then she thought, with a crashing shock which brought her awake, cold and shivering, out of bed and awake: I am in Hill House.<br>“What?” she cried out. “What? Theodora?”<br>“Eleanor? In here.”<br>“Coming.” No time for the light; she kicked a table out of the way, wondering at the noise of it, and struggled briefly with the door of the connecting bathroom. That is not the table falling, she thought; my mother is knocking on the wall. It was blessedly light in Theodora’s room, and Theodora was sitting up in bed, her hair tangled from sleep and her eyes wide with the shock of awakening; I must look the same way, Eleanor thought, and said, “I’m here, what is it? ”—and then heard, clearly for the first time, although she had been hearing it ever since she awakened. “What is it?” she whispered.<br>She sat down slowly on the foot of Theodora’s bed, wondering at what seemed calmness in herself. Now, she thought, now. It is only a noise, and terribly cold, terribly, terribly cold. It is a noise down the hall, far down at the end, near the nursery door, and terribly cold, not my mother knocking on the wall.<br>“Something is knocking on the doors,” Theodora said in a tone of pure rationality.<br>“That’s all. And it’s down near the other end of the hall. Luke and the doctor are probably there already, to see what is going on.” Not at all like my mother knocking on the wall; I was dreaming again.<br>“Bang bang,” Theodora said.<br>“Bang,” Eleanor said, and giggled. I am calm, she thought, but so very cold; the noise is only a kind of banging on the doors, one after another; is this what I was so afraid about? “Bang” is the best word for it; it sounds like something children do, not mothers knocking against the wall for help, and anyway Luke and the doctor are there; is this what they mean by cold chills going up and down your back? Because it is not pleasant; it starts in your stomach and goes in waves around and up and down again like something alive. Like something alive. Yes. Like something alive.<br>“Theodora,” she said, and closed her eyes and tightened her teeth together and wrapped her arms around herself, “it’s getting closer.”<br>“Just a noise,” Theodora said, and moved next to Eleanor and sat tight against her. “It has an echo.”<br>It sounded, Eleanor thought, like a hollow noise, a hollow bang, as though something were hitting the doors with an iron kettle, or an iron bar, or an iron glove. It pounded regularly for a minute, and then suddenly more softly, and then again in a quick flurry, seeming to be going methodically from door to door at the end of the hall. Distantly she thought she could hear the voices of Luke and the doctor, calling from somewhere below, and she thought, Then they are not up here with us at all, and heard the iron crashing against what must have been a door very close.<br>“Maybe it will go on down the other side of the hall,” Theodora whispered, and Eleanor thought that the oddest part of this indescribable experience was that Theodora should be having it too. “No,” Theodora said, and they heard the crash against the door across the hall. It was louder, it was deafening, it struck against the door next to them (did it move back and forth across the hall? did it go on feet along the carpet? did it lift a hand to the door?), and Eleanor threw herself away from the bed and ran to hold her hands against the door. “Go away,” she shouted wildly. “Go away, go away!”<br>There was complete silence, and Eleanor thought, standing with her face against the door, Now I’ve done it; it was looking for the room with someone inside.<br>The cold crept and pinched at them, filling and overflowing the room. Anyone would have thought that the inhabitants of Hill House slept sweetly in this quiet, and then, so suddenly that Eleanor wheeled around, the sound of Theodora’s teeth chattering, and Eleanor laughed. “You big baby,” she said.<br>“I’m cold,” Theodora said. “Deadly cold.”<br>“So am I.” Eleanor took the green quilt and threw it around Theodora, and took up Theodora’s warm dressing gown and put it on. “You warmer now?”<br>“Where’s Luke? Where’s the doctor?”<br>“I don’t know. Are you warmer now?”<br>“No.” Theodora shivered.<br>“In a minute I’ll go out in the hall and call them; are you—”<br>It started again, as though it had been listening, waiting to hear their voices and what they said, to identify them, to know how well prepared they were against it, waiting to hear if they were afraid. So suddenly that Eleanor leaped back against the bed and Theodora gasped and cried out, the iron crash came against their door, and both of them lifted their eyes in horror, because the hammering was against the upper edge of the door, higher than either of them could reach, higher than Luke or the doctor could reach, and the sickening, degrading cold came in waves from whatever was outside the door.<br>Eleanor stood perfectly still and looked at the door. She did not quite know what to do, although she believed that she was thinking coherently and was not unusually frightened, not more frightened, certainly, than she had believed in her worst dreams she could be. The cold troubled her even more than the sounds; even Theodora’s warm robe was useless against the icy little curls of fingers on her back. The intelligent thing to do, perhaps, was to walk over and open the door; that, perhaps, would belong with the doctor’s views of pure scientific inquiry. Eleanor knew that, even if her feet would take her as far as the door, her hand would not lift to the doorknob; impartially, remotely, she told herself that no one’s hand would touch that knob; it’s not the work hands were made for, she told herself. She had been rocking a little, each crash against the door pushing her a little backward, and now she was still because the noise was fading. “I’m going to complain to the janitor about the radiators,” Theodora said from behind her. “Is it stopping?”<br>“No,” Eleanor said, sick. “No.”<br>It had found them. Since Eleanor would not open the door, it was going to make its own way in. Eleanor said aloud, “Now I know why people scream, because I think I’m going to,” and Theodora said, “I will if you will,” and laughed, so that Eleanor turned quickly back to the bed and they held each other, listening in silence. Little pattings came from around the doorframe, small seeking sounds, feeling the edges of the door, trying to sneak a way in. The doorknob was fondled, and Eleanor, whispering, asked, “Is it locked?” and Theodora nodded and then, wide-eyed, turned to stare at the connecting bathroom door. “Mine’s locked too,” Eleanor said against her ear, and Theodora closed her eyes in relief. The little sticky sounds moved on around the doorframe and then, as though a fury caught whatever was outside, the crashing came again, and Eleanor and Theodora saw the wood of the door tremble and shake, and the door move against its hinges.<br>“You can’t get in,” Eleanor said wildly, and again there was a silence, as though the house listened with attention to her words, understanding, cynically agreeing, content to wait. A thin little giggle came, in a breath of air through the room, a little mad rising laugh, the smallest whisper of a laugh, and Eleanor heard it all up and down her back, a little gloating laugh moving past them around the house, and then she heard the doctor and Luke calling from the stairs and, mercifully, it was over.<br>When the real silence came, Eleanor breathed shakily and moved stiffly. “We’ve been clutching each other like a couple of lost children,” Theodora said and untwined her arms from around Eleanor’s neck. “You’re wearing my bathrobe.”<br>“I forgot mine. Is it really over?”<br>“For tonight, anyway.” Theodora spoke with certainty. “Can’t you tell? Aren’t you warm again?”<br>The sickening cold was gone, except for a reminiscent little thrill of it down Eleanor’s back when she looked at the door. She began to pull at the tight knot she had put in the bathrobe cord, and said, “Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock.”<br>“Intense shock is one of the symptoms I’ve got,” Theodora said. “Here come Luke and the doctor.” Their voices were outside in the hall, speaking quickly, anxiously, and Eleanor dropped Theodora’s robe on the bed and said, “For heaven’s sake, don’t let them knock on that door—one more knock would finish me”—and ran into her own room to get her own robe. Behind her she could hear Theodora telling them to wait a minute, and then going to unlock the door, and then Luke’s voice saying pleasantly to Theodora, “Why, you look as though you’d seen a ghost.”<br>When Eleanor came back she noticed that both Luke and the doctor were dressed, and it occurred to her that it might be a sound idea from now on; if that intense cold was going to come back at night it was going to find Eleanor sleeping in a wool suit and a heavy sweater, and she didn’t care what Mrs. Dudley was going to say when she found that at least one of the lady guests was lying in one of the clean beds in heavy shoes and wool socks. “Well,” she asked, “how do you gentlemen like living in a haunted house?”<br>“It’s perfectly fine,” Luke said, “perfectly fine. It gives me an excuse to have a drink in the middle of the night.” He had the brandy bottle and glasses, and Eleanor thought that they must make a companionable little group, the four of them, sitting around Theodora’s room at four in the morning, drinking brandy. They spoke lightly, quickly, and gave one another fast, hidden, little curious glances, each of them wondering what secret terror had been tapped in the others, what changes might show in face or gesture, what unguarded weakness might have opened the way to ruin.<br>“Did anything happen in here while we were outside?” the doctor asked.<br>Eleanor and Theodora looked at each other and laughed, honestly at last, without any edge of hysteria or fear. After a minute Theodora said carefully, “Nothing in particular. Someone knocked on the door with a cannon ball and then tried to get in and eat us, and started laughing its head off when we wouldn’t open the door. But nothing really out of the way.”<br>Curiously, Eleanor went over and opened the door. “I thought the whole door was going to shatter,” she said, bewildered, “and there isn’t even a scratch on the wood, nor on any of the other doors; they’re perfectly smooth.”<br>“How nice that it didn’t mar the woodwork,” Theodora said, holding her brandy glass out to Luke. “I couldn’t bear it if this dear old house got hurt.” She grinned at Eleanor. “Nellie here was going to scream.”<br>“So were you.”<br>“Not at all; I only said so to keep you company. Besides, Mrs. Dudley already said she wouldn’t come. And where were you, our manly defenders?”<br>“We were chasing a dog,” Luke said. “At least, some animal like a dog.” He stopped, and then went on reluctantly. “We followed it outside.”<br>Theodora stared, and Eleanor said, “You mean it was inside?”<br>“I saw it run past my door,” the doctor said, “just caught a glimpse of it, slipping along. I woke Luke and we followed it down the stairs and out into the garden and lost it somewhere back of the house.”<br>“The front door was open?”<br>“No,” Luke said. “The front door was closed. So were all the other doors. We checked.”<br>“We’ve been wandering around for quite a while,” the doctor said. “We never dreamed that you ladies were awake until we heard your voices.” He spoke gravely. “There is one thing we have not taken into account,” he said.<br>They looked at him, puzzled, and he explained, checking on his fingers in his lecture style. “First,” he said, “Luke and I were awakened earlier than you ladies, clearly; we have been up and about, outside and in, for better than two hours, led on what you perhaps might allow me to call a wild-goose chase. Second, neither of us”—he glanced inquiringly at Luke as he spoke—“heard any sound up here until your voices began. It was perfectly quiet. That is, the sound which hammered on your door was not audible to us. When we gave up our vigil and decided to come upstairs we apparently drove away whatever was waiting outside your door. Now, as we sit here together, all is quiet.”<br>“I still don’t see what you mean,” Theodora said, frowning.<br>“We must take precautions,” he said.<br>“Against what? How?”<br>“When Luke and I are called outside, and you two are kept imprisoned inside, doesn’t it begin to seem”—and his voice was very quiet—“doesn’t it begin to seem that the intention is, somehow, to separate us?”</p>

      <h3> PREVIEW:</h3>
      <p>THURSDAY<br>5 November<br> <br><br>Morgan's feet were freezing. The cold spell had arrived at about the same time as the submarine foundered, and it had only gotten worse during the past week. He loved his old cowboy boots but he couldn't fit thick socks in them. And anyway, there was a hole in one sole. Sure he could get some Chinese takeout for a hundred but he'd rather be cold.<br>It was nine-thirty in the morning and he was on his way home from the subway. He had been to the junkyard in Ulvsunda to see if they needed a hand, maybe make a couple of hundred, but business was bad. No winter boots this year either. He had had a cup of coffee with the guys in the office, which was overflowing with spare parts, catalogs, and pinup calendars, then headed to the subway.<br>Larry emerged from between the high-rises and, as usual, looked like he had just received a death sentence.<br>"Hey there, old man," Morgan yelled.<br>Larry nodded curtly, as if he had known from the moment he woke up this morning that Morgan would be standing here, then walked over to him.<br>"Hi. How's it going?"<br>"My toes are freezing, my car's at the junkyard, I have no work, and I'm on my way home to have a bowl of instant soup. How about you?"<br>Larry walked on in the direction of Bjornsonsgatan, taking the path through the park.<br>"Thought I'd visit Herbert in the hospital. Coming?"<br>"Has his mind cleared up?"<br>"No, he's like he was before, I think."<br>"Then I'll pass. That kind of stuff gets me down. Last time he thought I was his mother, wanted me to tell him a story."<br>"And did you?"<br>"Sure. I told him the one about Goldilocks and the Three Bears. But no. I'm not in the mood today."<br>They kept walking. When Morgan saw that Larry was wearing a pair of thick gloves he realized his own hands were freezing and he pushed them-with some difficulty-into the narrow pockets of his denim jacket. The underpass where Jocke had disappeared came into view.<br>Maybe as a way to avoid talking about that Larry said:<br>"Did you see the paper this morning? Now Falldin is saying that the Russians have nuclear weapons onboard."<br>"What did he think they had? Slingshots?"<br>"No, but… it's been there for a week now. What if it had blown up?"<br>"Don't worry about it. Those Russians know their stuff."<br>"You know I'm not a Communist."<br>"And I am?"<br>"Let's put it this way: who'd you vote for in the last election? The Liberals?"<br>"That doesn't mean I've pledged allegiance to Moscow."<br>They had been through this before. Now they took up the old routine in order not to see, not to have to think about it as they approached the underpass. But even so their voices died away as they walked under the bridge and came to a halt. Both of them had the impression it was the other guy who had stopped first. They looked at the piles of leaves that had turned into piles of snow, and that had taken on shapes that made them uneasy. Larry shook his head.<br>"What the hell do you do, you know?"<br>Morgan pushed his hands deeper into his pockets, stomping his feet to keep warm.<br>"Gosta's the only one who can do anything."<br>They both looked in the direction of Gosta's apartment. There were no curtains; the windowpane was streaked with dirt.<br>Larry held out a packet of cigarettes. Morgan took one, then Larry, who lit them both. They stood there smoking, contemplating the snowdrifts. After a while their thoughts were interrupted by the sound of children's voices.<br>A group of children carrying skates and helmets came streaming out of the school, led by a man with a military air. The children walked at intervals of a few meters from each other, almost in step. They passed Morgan and Larry. Morgan nodded at a kid he recognized from his building.<br>"Going off to war?"<br>The kid shook his head, was about to say something, but kept on marching, afraid of falling out of step. They kept on going toward the hospital; they were probably having a field trip of some sort. Morgan ground the cigarette under his foot, cupped his hands around his mouth, and shouted:<br>"Airborne attack! Take cover!"<br>Larry chuckled, extinguishing his cigarette.<br>"Jesus Christ. I didn't think that kind of teacher even existed anymore; the kind who wants even the coats to hang at attention. Are you going to come along?"<br>"No, not up for it today. But you run along. If you hurry you'll be able to fall in step with the rest."<br>"See you later."<br>"Will do."<br>They parted in the underpass. Larry left at a slow pace in the same direction as the children, and Morgan walked up the stairs. Now his entire body was freezing. Soup out of a packet wasn't so bad, particularly if you put a dash of milk in it.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Oskar was walking with his teacher. He needed to talk to someone and his teacher was the only one he could think of. Even so he would have switched groups given the chance. Jonny and Micke normally never chose the walking group when they had field trips, but they had today. They had whispered about something this morning, looking at him.<br>So Oskar walked with his teacher, not sure himself if it was for protection or because he needed to talk to a grown-up.<br>He had been going steady with Eli for five days now. They met every evening, outside. Oskar always told his mom he was going out to see Johan.<br>Yesterday evening Eli had come in through his window again. They had lain awake for a long time, told each other stories that started where the other person stopped. Then they had fallen asleep with their arms around each other and in the morning Eli was gone.<br>In his pocket, next to the old, well-thumbed, worn one there was now a new note that he had found on his desk this morning as he was getting ready to go to school.<br>I MUST BE GONE AND LIVE, OR STAY AND DIE. YOURS, ELI.<br>He knew it was a quote from Romeo and Juliet. Eli had told him that what she wrote in her first note came from there and Oskar had checked out the book from the school library. He liked it quite a bit, even though there were a lot of words he didn't understand. Her vestal livery is but sick and green. Did Eli understand all those words?<br>Jonny, Micke, and the girls were walking twenty meters behind Oskar and the teacher. They passed China Park where some daycare kids were sledding, their sharp cries slicing through the air. Oskar kicked at a clump of snow, lowered his voice and said:<br>"Marie-Louise?"<br>"Yes?"<br>"How do you know when you're in love?"<br>"Oh, I…"<br>His teacher pushed her hands into the pockets of her duffel coat and cast a glance at the sky. Oskar wondered if she was thinking of that guy that had come and waited for her at the school a few times. Oskar had not liked the look of him. He looked creepy.<br>"It depends on who you are, but… I would say that it's when you know… or at least when you really believe that this is the person you always want to be with."<br>"You mean, when you feel you can't live without that person."<br>"Yes, exactly. Two who can't live without the other… isn't that what love is?"<br>"Like Romeo and Juliet'.'<br>"Yes, and the bigger the obstacles… have you seen it?"<br>"Read it."<br>His teacher looked at him and gave him a smile that Oskar had always liked before but that he right now found a little disconcerting. He said quickly,<br>"What if it's two guys?"<br>"Then that's friendship. That's also a form of love. Or if you mean… well, two guys can also love each other in that way."<br>"How do they do it?"<br>His teacher lowered her voice.<br>"Well, not that there's anything wrong with it, but… if you want to talk more about it we'll have to come back to it another time."<br>They walked a few paces in silence, arrived at the hill that led down to Kvarnviken Bay. Ghost Hill. His teacher drew the smell of pine forest deep into her lungs. Then she said:<br>"You form a covenant with someone, a union. Regardless of whether you're a boy or a girl you form a covenant saying that… that it's you and that person. Something just between the two of you."<br>Oskar nodded. He heard the girls' voices getting closer. Soon they would come and claim the teacher's attention. That's what normally happened. He was walking so close to his teacher that their coats touched, and he said:<br>"Can you be… both girl and boy at the same time? Or neither?"<br>"No, not people. There are some kinds of animals that…"<br>Michelle ran up to them and shouted in her squeaky voice: "Miss! Jonny put snow down my back!"<br>They were halfway down the hill. Shortly thereafter all the girls were there and told her what Jonny and Micke had done.<br>Oskar slowed down, fell back a few paces. He turned around. Jonny and Micke were at the top of the hill. They waved to Oskar, who didn't wave back. Instead he reached for a big branch on the side of the path, stripping the small twigs off it as he walked.<br>He passed the reputedly haunted house that gave the hill its name. A giant warehouse with walls of corrugated iron that looked completely out of place among the small trees. On the wall that faced the hill someone had sprayed in large letters:<br> <br><br>CAN WE HAVE YOUR MOPED?<br> <br><br>The girls and the teacher played tag, running down the path along the water. He was not planning to catch up to them. He knew Jonny and Micke were behind him. He gripped his stick more tightly, kept going.<br>It was nice out today. The ice had formed several days ago and now it was thick enough that the skating group could go out on it, led by Mr. Avila. When Jonny and Micke said they wanted to join the walking group, Oskar had seriously thought about rushing home to grab his skates, switchir five days now. They met every evening, outside. Oskar always told his mom he was going out to see Johan.<br>Yesterday evening Eli had come in through his window again. They had lain awake for a long time, told each other stories that started where the other person stopped. Then they had fallen asleep with their arms around each other and in the morning Eli was gone.<br>In his pocket, next to the old, well-thumbed, worn one there was now a new note that he had found on his desk this morning as he was getting ready to go to school.<br>I MUST BE GONE AND LIVE, OR STAY AND DIE. YOURS, ELI.<br>He knew it was a quote from Romeo and Juliet. Eli had told him that what she wrote in her first note came from there and Oskar had checked out the book from the school library. He liked it quite a bit, even though there were a lot of words he didn't understand. Her vestal livery is but sick and green. "<br>Then they were on the ice. There was nothing for him to brace his feet against. They dragged him backwards, toward the sauna bathing hole. His heels made double tracks in the snow. In between them he dragged the stick, drawing a shallower line in the middle.<br>Far away on the ice he saw tiny moving figures. He screamed. Screamed for help.<br>"Holler away. Maybe they'll come in time to pull you out."<br>The open water gaped darkly only a few steps away. Oskar tensed all the muscles he could muster and flung himself to the side, twisting with a sudden wrenching motion. Micke lost his grip. Oskar dangled from Jonny's arms and swung the stick against his shin; it almost bounced out of his hand when wood met leg.<br>"Oww, damn!"<br>Jonny let go of him and Oskar fell to the ice. He got up at the edge of the hole in the ice, holding the stick in both hands. Jonny grabbed his shin.<br>"Fucking idiot. Now I'll fucking…"<br>Jonny approached him slowly, probably not daring to run because he was afraid of falling into the water himself if he pushed Oskar like that. He pointed at the stick.<br>"Put that down or I'll kill you. Get it?"<br>Oskar clenched his teeth. When Jonny was a little more than an arm's length away, Oscar swung the stick against his shoulder. Jonny ducked and Oskar felt a mute thwack in his hands when the heavy end of the stick struck Jonny square on the ear. He fell to the side like a bowling pin, landing outstretched on the ice, howling.<br>Micke, who had been a couple of steps behind Jonny, now started to back up, holding his hands in front of him.<br>"What the hell… we were just having some fun… didn't think…"<br>Oskar walked toward him, swinging the stick from side to side through the air with a low growl. Micke turned and ran back to shore. Oskar stopped and lowered his stick.<br>Jonny lay curled up on his side with his hand pressed against his ear. Blood was trickling out between his fingers. Oskar wanted to apologize. He hadn't meant to hurt him so bad. He crouched down next to Jonny, steadying himself on the stick, and he was about to say "sorry" but before he had a chance, he saw Jonny.<br>He was so small, curled up into a fetal position, whimpering "ow-owowow" while a thin trickle of blood ran down inside the collar of his coat. He was slowly turning his head back and forth.<br>Oskar looked at him in wonder.<br>That tiny bleeding bundle on the ice would not be able to do anything to him. Couldn't hit him or tease him. Couldn't even defend itself.<br>I could whack him a few more times and then it's all over.<br>Oskar stood up, leaned on the stick. The rush was ebbing away, replaced by a feeling of nausea that welled up from deep inside his stomach. What had he done? Jonny must be really hurt to be bleeding like that. What if he bled to death? Oskar sat down on the ice again, pulled off one shoe and removed his wool sock. He crawled over to Jonny on his knees, poked the hand that he was holding to his ear, and pushed the wool sock into it.<br>"Here. Take this."<br>Jonny grabbed the sock and pressed it to his wounded ear. Oskar looked up over the ice. He saw a person on skates approaching. A grown-up.<br>Shrill screams from far away. Children, screaming in panic. A single high, penetrating shriek that was joined by others after a few seconds. The person who had been on his way over, stopped. Stood motionless for a second, then turned and skated back.<br>Oskar was still kneeling beside Jonny, felt the snow melting, dampening his knees. Jonny had his eyes shut, whimpering from between clenched teeth. Oskar lowered his face closer to his.<br>"Can you walk?"<br>Jonny opened his mouth to say something and a yellow- and white-colored liquid gushed out from between his lips, coloring the snow. A little landed on one of Oskar's hands. He looked at the slimy drops that quivered on the back of his hands and became really scared. He dropped the stick and ran toward land to get some help.<br>The children's screams from next to the hospital had increased in volume. He ran toward them.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Mr. Avila, Fernando Cristobal de Reyes y Avila, enjoyed ice skating. Yes. One of the things he most appreciated about Sweden was the long winters. He had participated in the Vasa cross-country ski race for ten consecutive<br>years now, and whenever the waters of the outer archipelago froze solid he drove out to Graddo Island on the weekends in order to skate out as far toward Soderarm as the ice cover allowed.<br>It was three years ago since the archipelago had frozen last, but an early winter such as this one gave him hope. Of course Graddo Island would be crawling with skating enthusiasts if the waters froze, but that was in the daytime. Mr. Avila preferred to skate at night.<br>With all due respect to the Vasa Race, it did make one feel like one of a thousand ants in a colony that had suddenly decided to emigrate. It was quite different to be on the open ice, alone in the moonlight. Fernando Avila was only a lukewarm Catholic, but even he could feel in those moments that God was near.<br>The rhythmic scrape of the metal blades, the moonlight that gave the ice a leaden gleam, above him the stars vaulted in their infinity, the cold wind streaming over his face, eternity and depth and space in all directions. Life could not be bigger.<br>A little boy was tugging on his pant leg.<br>"Teacher, I have to pee."<br>Avila woke from his skating dreams and looked around, pointed to some trees by the shore that grew out over the water; the bare network of branches fell like a shielding curtain toward the ice.<br>"You can pee there."<br>The boy squinted at the trees.<br>"On the ice?"<br>"Yes? What is wrong with that? Makes new ice. Yellow."<br>The boy looked at him as if he were crazy, but skated off toward the trees.<br>Avila looked around and made sure none of the older ones had wandered too far. With a few quick strokes he took off to get an overview of the situation. Counted the children. Yes. Nine, plus the one who was peeing. Ten.<br>He turned the other way and looked in toward Kvarnviken, stopped.<br>Something was happening down there. A group of bodies approaching something that had to be an opening in the ice, the spot marked by small straggly trees. While he stood still, watching, the group broke up. He saw that one of them was holding a stick.<br>The stick was swung and one boy fell down. He heard a howl. Turning around, he checked his own group one last time, then set off swiftly toward the figures by the hole. One of them was now running toward land.<br>That was when he heard the scream.<br>The piercing scream of a child from his group. The snow spurted up around his blades as he made an abrupt halt. He had managed to ascertain that the kids by the hole were older. Maybe Oskar. Older boys. They would manage. His charges were younger.<br>The scream increased in intensity and when he turned and skated toward it he heard more voices join in.<br>Cojones!<br>Something happened in the exact moment when he was not there. Dear God, let the ice not have given way. He skated as fast as he could, the snow whirling around his blades as he sprinted toward the source of the scream. He saw now that many children had gathered, were standing and screaming hysterically in a choir of sorts, and more were on their way. He also saw that an adult was moving down toward the ice from up by the hospital.<br>With a few final strong pushes he arrived next to the children, and stopped so hard a fine ice-dust sprayed over the children's jackets. He did not understand. All the children were gathered next to the network of branches, looking down toward the ice, and shrieking.<br>He skated closer.<br>"What is it?"<br>One of the children pointed down toward the ice, to a lump that was frozen into it. It looked like a brown, frozen clump of grass with a red line on one side. Or a run-over hedgehog. He leaned down toward the clump and saw that it was a head. A human head frozen into the ice so that only the top of the head and forehead were visible.<br>The boy he had sent off to pee here was sitting on the ice a few meters away, sobbing.<br>"I-I-I ra-a-an into it."<br>Avila straightened up.<br>"Get away! Everyone goes back onto land nowl"<br>The children seemed as if they were also frozen in place in the ice; the little ones kept crying. He took out his whistle and blew into it sharply,<br>twice. The screams stopped. He took a few pushes to position himself behind the children in order to herd them toward the shore. The children went. Only a fifth grader stayed where he was, leaning down toward the clump, full of curiosity.<br>"You too!"<br>Avila gestured to him with his hand, indicating he should come over. Once they were on land he said to the woman who had come down from the hospital, "Call the police. An ambulance. There is a body frozen into the ice."<br>The woman ran back up to the hospital. Avila counted the children on land, saw that one was missing. The boy who had run into the head was still sitting on the ice with his face in his hands. Avila glided out to him and lifted him up by his armpits. The boy turned around and put his arms around Avila, who lifted the boy as gently as if he were a fragile package and carried him to shore.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Can I talk to him?"<br>"He can't actually talk…"<br>"No, but he understands what is said to him."<br>"I would think so but…"<br>"Just for a little while."<br>Through the fog that clouded his vision Hakan saw a man in dark clothes pull up a chair and sit down next to his bed. He could not make out the man's features, but there was probably a serious expression on his face.<br>The last few days Hakan had been floating in and out of a red cloud scored through with lines as thin as hairs. He knew that they had anesthetized him a couple of times, operated on him. This was the first day he was fully conscious, but he did not know how many days had passed since he first came here.<br>Earlier this morning Hakan had been exploring his new face with the fingers on his feeling hand. A rubberlike bandage covered his whole face, but from what little he was able to make out after painfully exploring the contours protruding under the bandage with his fingertips, he concluded he no longer had a face.<br>Hakan Bengtsson no longer existed. All that was left of him was an unidentified body in a hospital bed. They would of course be able to connect him with the other murders, but not to his earlier or present life. Not to Eli.<br>"How are you feeling?"<br>Oh, very well, officer, thank you. Couldn't he better. It feels as if someone has applied burning napalm to my face but other than that I can't complain.<br>"Yes, I understand that you can't speak, but perhaps you can nod if you hear what I am saying? Can you nod?"<br>I can, but I don't want to.<br>The man next to his bed sighed.<br>"You tried to kill yourself by doing this, so clearly you are not completely… gone. Is it hard for you to raise your head? Can you lift your hand if you hear me? Can you lift your hand?"<br>Hakan disconnected himself from all thoughts of the policeman and instead started to think about the place in Dante's Hell, Limbo, where all the great souls from Earth without knowledge of Christ went after death. Tried to imagine the place in detail.<br>"We would like to know who you are, you see."<br>Which circle did Dante himself go to after death…<br>The policeman pulled his chair even closer.<br>"We'll find that out, you know. Sooner or later. You could save us some legwork by communicating with us now."<br>No one misses me. No one knows me. Go ahead, try.<br>A nurse came in. "There's a telephone call for you."<br>The policemanman stood up, walked over to the door. Before he walked out he turned around.<br>"I'll be back."<br>Hakan's thoughts now returned to more significant matters. Which circle was he destined for? The circle of child murderers? That was the seventh circle. On the other hand, maybe the first circle. Those who sinned for love's sake. Then, of course, the sodomites had their own circle. The most reasonable thing would be to assume you went to the circle that represented your worst crime. Therefore: if you had committed an absolutely terrible crime you could thereafter sin away all you liked with<br>the crimes punished in higher circles. It couldn't get worse. Like murderers in the USA who were sentenced to three hundred years in prison.<br>The different circles whirled in their spiral patterns. The funnel of Hell. Cerberus with his tail. Hakan imagined the violent men, the bitter women, the proud ones in their boiling pots, in their fire rain, wandering among them, looking for their place.<br>One thing he was completely sure of. He would never end up in the lowest circle. The one where Lucifer himself chewed on Judas and Brutus, standing in a sea of ice. The circle of traitors.<br>The door opened again, with that strange, sucking sound. The policeman sat down next to the bed.<br>"Hello again. It seems like they've found another one, down by the lake in Blackeberg. Same rope, in any case."<br>No!<br>Hakan's body flinched involuntarily when the policeman said Blackeberg. The policeman nodded. "Apparently you can hear me. That's good. We can assume you live in the western suburbs then. Where? Racksta? Vallingby? Blackeberg?"<br>The memory of how he had disposed of the man down by the hospital raced through his head. He had been sloppy. He had screwed up.<br>"OK, then I am going to leave you alone. You can think about if you want to cooperate. It'll be easier that way. Don't you think?"<br>The policeman stood up and left. In his place a nurse came in and sat down in the chair, keeping watch.<br>Hakan started to toss his head from side to side, in denial. His hand went out and started to tug on the tube to the respirator. The nurse quickly jumped up and tore his hand away.<br>"We'll have to tie you up. One more time and we'll tie you up. Understood? If you don't want to live that's your business but as long as you're here our job is to keep you alive. Regardless of what you have or haven't done. Got it? And we will do what we have to in order to get through this even if it means putting restraints on you. Do you hear me? Everything will be better for you if you cooperate."<br>Cooperate. Cooperate. Suddenly everyone wants to cooperate. I am no longer a person. I am a project. Oh my God. Eli, Eli. Help me.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Oskar heard his mom's voice as soon as he was in the stairwell. She was talking to someone on the phone, and she sounded angry. Jonny's mom? He stopped outside the door and listened.<br>"They're going to call me and ask me what I've done wrong… oh yes, they will, and what do I say? Sorry, but you see, my boy doesn't have a father and that… but live up to it then… no, you haven't… I think you should talk to him about this."<br>Oskar unlocked the door and stepped into the hall. His mom said, "That's him now" into the receiver and turned to Oskar.<br>"They called from school and I… you'll have to talk to your dad about this because I…" She talked into the receiver again. "Now you can… I am calm… it's easy for you to say, sitting out there…"<br>Oskar went into his room, lay down on his bed and put his hands over his face. It felt like his heart was beating in his head.<br>When he'd reached the hospital he had initially thought that all the people running around had something to do with Jonny. But it had turned out that wasn't it. Today he had seen a dead person for the first time in his life.<br>His mom opened the door to his room. Oskar removed his hands from his head.<br>"Your father wants to talk to you."<br>Oskar held the receiver to his ear and heard a distant voice reciting the names of lighthouses and wind strength, wind direction. He waited with the receiver to his ear without saying anything. His mom frowned and looked questioningly at him. Oskar put his hand over the earpiece and whispered: "the marine weather report."<br>His mom opened her mouth as if to say something, but only came out with a sigh and let her hands drop. She walked out into the kitchen. Oskar sat down on the chair in the hall and listened to the marine weather report along with his dad.<br>He knew his dad would remain distracted by what was said on the radio if Oskar tried to start a conversation now. The sea report was holy. Those times he was at his dad's, all activity in the house came to a stop at 16:45 and his dad sat down next to the radio while staring absently out over the fields, as if to check that what they were saying on the radio was true.<br>It was a long time since his dad had been at sea, but old habits died hard.<br>Almagrundet northwest eight, toward evening turning to the west. Good visibility. The Aland Sea and Archipelago area northwest ten, toward evening warning for gale-force winds. Good visibility.<br>There. The most important part of it was over.<br>"Hi Dad."<br>"Oh, it's you. Hi there. We're going to have gale-force winds here toward evening."<br>"Yeah, I heard."<br>"Hm. How are things?"<br>"Good."<br>"You know, your mom just told me about this thing with Jonny. That doesn't sound so good."<br>"No, I guess not."<br>"He got a concussion."<br>"Yeah, he threw up."<br>"That's a common side effect. Harry… yes, you've met him… he took the lead weight in the side of the head once and he… well, he lay there on deck and was sick as a calf after that."<br>"Was he OK?"<br>"Sure he was… well, he died last spring. But that wasn't anything to do with that. No. He got better real fast."<br>"Good."<br>"And we'll have to hope the same goes for this boy, too."<br>"Yes."<br>The voice on the radio kept reciting names of various sea regions: Bottenviken and all the rest. A couple of times he had sat at his dad's place with an atlas in front of him and followed all the lighthouses as they were named. For a while he knew all the places by heart, in order, but he had since forgotten them. His dad cleared his throat.<br>"Yes, your mom and I were talking about it… if you wanted to come out and see me this weekend."<br>"Mmmm."<br>"So we could talk more about this and about… everything."<br>"This weekend?"<br>"Yes, if you feel like it."<br>"I guess so. But I have a little… what about Saturday?"<br>"Or Friday night."<br>"No, but… Saturday. Morning."<br>"That sounds good. I'll take an eider duck out of the freezer."<br>Oskar pressed the mouthpiece closer and whispered: "Preferably without shot."<br>His dad laughed.<br>Last fall when Oskar had been out at his place he had broken a tooth on some shot left in a sea bird that they had eaten. He had told his mom it was a stone in a potato. Sea bird was Oskar's favorite food, but his mom thought it was "terribly cruel" to shoot such defenceless birds. If she knew he had broken a tooth on the instrument of murder itself it might lead to a moratorium on eating that kind of food altogether.<br>"I'll check extra carefully," his dad said.<br>"Is the moped running?"<br>"Yes, why?"<br>"No, I was just thinking."<br>"I see. Well, there's a fair amount of snow so we can probably make a round."<br>"Good."<br>"OK, I'll see you on Saturday. You'll take the ten o'clock bus."<br>"Yes."<br>"I'll come meet you. With the moped. The car is not completely functional."<br>"OK, great. Are you going to talk more to Mom?"<br>"Uh… no… you can tell her our plans, right?"<br>"Uh-huh. See you."<br>"That you will. Bye."<br>Oskar put the phone down. Sat there for a little while and imagined how it was going to be. Taking the moped out for a ride. That was fun. Oskar would strap on the mini-skis and they attached a rope to the moped carrier with a stick at the other end. Oskar held the tow rope with both hands and then he motored around the village like a snowborne waterskier. This as well as duck with rowanberry jelly. And only one night away from Eli.<br> <br><br>He went to his room and packed up his workout gear, plus his knife, since he wasn't coming home before meeting Eli. He had a plan. When he was standing in the hall putting his coat on his mom came out of the kitchen and dried her floury hands on the apron. "So? What did he say?"<br>"I'm going to his place on Saturday."<br>"Fine, but what about the other thing?"<br>"I have to go work out now."<br>"He didn't say anything else?"<br>"Ye-es, but I have to go now."<br>"Where?"<br>"The pool."<br>"What pool?"<br>"The one next to our school. The little one."<br>"What are you doing there?"<br>"Working out. I'll be back around half past eight. Or nine. I'm meeting Johan afterwards."<br>His mom looked dismayed, didn't know what to do with her floury hands and stuck them both in the big pocket on the front of the apron.<br>"Yes, I see. Be careful. Don't trip on the side of the pool or anything. Do you have your hat with you?" Yes, yes.<br>"Well, put it on. When you've been in the water, because it's cold out and when your hair is wet and…"<br>Oskar took a step forward, kissed her lightly on the cheek and said: "good-bye," and left. When he came out of the front door to the building he glanced up at his window. His mom was standing there, with her hands still pushed into the big apron pocket. Oskar waved. His mom slowly lifted up a hand and waved back.<br>He cried half the way to the pool.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>The gang stood assembled in the stairwell outside Gosta's door. Lacke, Virginia, Morgan, Larry, Karlsson. No one wanted to be the one to ring the doorbell, since this seemed to give the person who rang the responsibility to declare the reason for their visit. Even out in the stairwell you got<br>a whiff of Gosta. Urine. Morgan poked Karlsson in the side and mumbled something. Karlsson lifted the earmuffs he wore instead of a hat and asked: "What?"<br>"I said, don't you think you can take those off for once? Makes you look like an idiot."<br>"That's your opinion."<br>But he removed the earmuffs, put them in the coat pocket and said:<br>"It'll have to be you, Larry. You're the one who saw it."<br>Larry sighed and rang the doorbell. An angry yowl from inside and then a soft thud as something landed on the floor. Larry cleared his throat. He didn't like this. Felt like a cop with the whole gang behind him; the only thing missing was the cocked pistols. Shuffled steps came from inside the apartment, then a voice.<br>"Are you alright, sweetheart?"<br>The door opened. A wave of urine-stench washed over Larry's face and he struggled for breath. Gosta was standing in the doorway, dressed in a worn shirt, vest, and tie. An orange- and white-striped cat was curled up under one arm.<br>"Yes?"<br>"Hi, Gosta. How's it going?"<br>Gosta's eyes roamed over their faces. He was pretty drunk. Fine.<br>"So, we're all here because… do you know what's happened?"<br>"No."<br>"Well, you see, they've found Jocke. Today."<br>"I see. Oh. Yes."<br>"And then… you know…"<br>Larry turned his head, seeking support from his delegation. The only thing he got was an encouraging gesture from Morgan. Larry couldn't handle standing out here like some official representative, presenting his ultimatum. There was only one way, however much he didn't like it. He asked: "Can we come in?"<br>He had anticipated some kind of resistance. Gosta was hardly used to five people dropping by to see him like this. But Gosta simply nodded and backed up a few steps in the hall to let them in.<br>Larry hesitated for a moment; the smell emanating from inside the<br>apartment was unbelievable. It hovered in the air like viscous matter. During this moment of hesitation Lacke took a step inside, followed by Virginia. Lacke scratched the cat-still in Gosta's arms-behind the ears.<br>"Nice cat. What's its name?"<br>"It's a she. Thisbe."<br>"Nice name. Do you have a Pyramus as well?"<br>"No."<br>One by one they glided in through the door, tried to breathe through their mouths. After a minute everyone gave up the attempt to keep the stench at bay, relaxed, and got used to it. Cats were shooed out of the couch and armchair, a few chairs were carried out from the kitchen, vodka, grape tonic, and glasses appeared on the table, and after a few minutes of chitchat about cats and the weather Gosta said:<br>"So, they found Jocke."<br>Larry downed the last of his drink. His task felt easier with the warmth of the alcohol in his stomach. He poured himself a new glass and said, "Yes, down by the hospital. His body was frozen into the ice."<br>"In the ice?"<br>"Yes. Damned circus down there today. I was down there to see Herbert, don't know if you know him, anyway… when I came out there were cops everywhere and an ambulance and after a while the fire truck came."<br>"There was a fire?"<br>"No, but they had to hack him out of the ice. Well, at that point I didn't know it was him but then when they got him up on land I recognized the clothes, because the face… there had been ice all around it, so you couldn't… but the clothes…"<br>Gosta waved his hand in the air as if he was petting a big, invisible dog.<br>"Wait a minute now… so he drowned?… I mean, I don't understand…" Larry sipped his drink, wiped his hand over his mouth.<br>"No, that was what the cops thought at first too. At first. From what I understand. They were mostly standing around up there with their arms folded and the ambulance guys were all busy with some kid who turned up bleeding from his head, so there was…"<br>Gosta petted the invisible dog even more energetically, or he was<br>trying to push it away. A little of his drink splashed out of his glass and landed on the rug.<br>"Hang on a minute… now I can't… bleeding from his head?"<br>Morgan put down the cat he had been holding on his lap, and brushed off his pants.<br>"That had nothing to do with it. Come on now, Larry."<br>"Yes, but then when they got him up on land. And I saw that it was him. And then you also saw that there was a rope like this, see. Tied up. And there were some kind of stones wrapped up in the rope like that. That got the cops going. Started talking into their radios and cordoning off the area with tape and shooing people away and all that. Got really interested all of a sudden. So that… well, turns out someone must have tried to dump his body there, pure and simple."<br>Gosta leaned back in the couch, holding his hand over his eyes. Virginia, who was sitting between him and Lacke, patted his knee. Morgan filled his glass and said: "The thing is they found Jocke, right? Want some tonic with that? Here. They found Jocke and now they know he was murdered. And that kind of changes things, don't you think?"<br>Karlsson cleared his throat, and said in a commanding tone:<br>"In the Swedish judicial system there's something called…"<br>"You shut up," Morgan interrupted. "Is it alright if I smoke?"<br>Gosta nodded feebly. While Morgan was taking out his cigarette and lighter Lacke leaned over in the sofa so he could look Gosta in the eye.<br>"Gosta. You saw what happened. That story should be told."<br>"Be told. How?"<br>"By going to the police and telling them what you saw. That's all."<br>"No… No.'<br>The room got quiet.<br>Lacke sighed, poured himself half a glass of vodka and a little dash of tonic, took a big gulp, and closed his eyes as the burning cloud filled his stomach. He didn't want to force him.<br>Back at the Chinese restaurant Karlsson had ranted about the duty of a witness and legal responsibility but however much Lacke wanted the person who had done this to be caught he had no intention of sending the cops to a friend like some squealer.<br>A gray-speckled cat pushed its head against his shins. He picked it up into his lap and stroked it absently. What does it matter? Jocke was dead, he knew that now for sure. What did the rest matter, anyway?<br>Morgan got up, walked over to the window with the glass in his hand.<br>"Was this where you were standing? When you saw it?"… yes.<br>Morgan nodded, sipped the drink.<br>"Yes, I get it. You can see everything from here. Great place, actually. Nice view. Yes, I mean apart from… great view."<br>A tear ran quietly down Lacke's cheek. Virginia took his hand and squeezed it. Lacke took another big gulp to burn away the pain that was tearing at his chest.<br>Larry, who for a time had been watching the cats moving around the room in senseless patterns, drummed his fingers against his glass and said:<br>"What if we simply tipped them off? About the location, I mean. Maybe they can find some fingerprints and… whatever else it is they find."<br>Karlsson smiled.<br>"And how do we say we got this information? That we just know it? They're going to be pretty interested in how… in who we got this information from."<br>"We could make an anonymous call. Just to get the information out there."<br>Gosta mumbled something from the couch. Virginia leaned her head in toward him.<br>"What did you say?"<br>Gosta spoke in a very small voice as he stared into his drink.<br>"Please forgive me. But I'm too scared. I can't."<br>Morgan turned back from the window, held his arm out.<br>"That's how it is, then. Nothing more to talk about." He gave Karlsson a sharp look. "We'll have to think of an alternative. Do it some other way. Maybe make a sketch, call, whatever. We'll think of something."<br>He walked over to Gosta and nudged his foot with his own.<br>"Hey you, now. Pull yourself together. We'll take care of this thing anyway. Take it easy. Gosta? Can you hear me? We'll take care of this. Cheers!"<br>He stretched out his glass, clinked it against Gosta's and took a sip. "We'll fix this thing. Won't we?"<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>He had left the others outside the gymnasium and started to head home when he heard her voice coming from the school.<br>"Psst. Oskar!"<br>Footsteps on stairs and she emerged from the shadows. She had been sitting there, waiting. Then she heard him say good-bye to the others and how they answered as if he was a completely normal person.<br>The workout session had been good. He wasn't as weak as he had thought, was able to do more than a couple of the guys who had been there several times before. And his concern that Mr. Avila would interrogate him about what had happened out there on the ice today turned out to be unfounded. Mr. Avila had simply asked: "Do you want to talk about it?" and when Oskar shook his head they left it at that.<br>The gym was another world, separate from school. Mr. Avila was less severe and the other guys left him alone. Micke hadn't been there, of course. Was Micke scared of him now? The thought was enough to make his head spin.<br>He walked over to meet Eli.<br>"Hi."<br>"Hey."<br>Without saying anything about it they had switched their words of greeting. Eli was wearing a checkered shirt that was much too big for her and she looked… shriveled again. Her skin was dry and her face thinner. Even yesterday Oskar had seen the first white hairs and tonight there were many more.<br>When she was healthy Oskar thought she was the cutest girl he had seen. But the way she looked right now she was… you couldn't compare her to anyone. No one looked like that. Dwarves, maybe. But dwarves weren't thin like that… nothing was. He was grateful she hadn't appeared in front of the others.<br>"How's it going?" he asked. "So so."<br>"Want to do something?"<br>"Of course."<br>They walked home side by side. Oskar had a plan. They were going to enter into a pact together. If they entered into a pact together, Eli would become healthy. A magical thought, inspired by the books he had read. But magic… surely there was a little magic in the world. The people who denied the existence of magic, they were the ones that it went badly for.<br>They walked into the yard. He touched Eli's shoulder.<br>"Should we check the garbage room?"<br>"OK."<br>They walked in through Eli's front door and Oskar unlocked the door to the basement.<br>"Don't you have a basement key?" he asked.<br>"I don't think so."<br>It was pitch black in the basement entrance. The door slammed shut behind them with a heavy sound. They stood still, side by side, breathing. Oskar whispered:<br>"Eli, you know what? Today… Jonny and Micke tried to throw me into the water. Into a hole in the ice."<br>"No! You-"<br>"Wait. Do you know what I did? I had a stick, a big stick. I hit Jonny in the head with it so he started to bleed. He got a concussion, went to the hospital. I never ended up in the water. I… beat him."<br>Quiet for a few moments. Then Eli said:<br>"Oskar."<br>"Yes."<br>"Yippee."<br>Oskar stretched his hand to the light switch; he wanted to see her face. Turned it on. She was staring straight into his eyes and he saw her pupils. For a few moments before they got used to the light they looked like those crystals they talked about in physics class, what were they called… elliptical.<br>Like a lizard. No. Cats. Cats.<br>Eli blinked. Her pupils were normal again.<br>"What is it?"<br>"Nothing. Come on…"<br>Oskar walked over to the bulk item trash room and opened the door. The bag was almost full, hadn't been emptied for a while. Eli squeezed in beside him and they rummaged through the trash. Oskar found a bag with empty bottles that you could get a deposit back on. Eli found a plastic sword, waved it around, said:<br>"Should we check the one next door?"<br>"No, Tommy and those guys might be there."<br>"Who are they?"<br>"Oh, some older guys who use a basement storage unit… they hang out there in the evening."<br>"Are there a lot of them?"<br>"No, three. Most of the time it's just Tommy."<br>"And they're dangerous?"<br>Oskar shrugged. "Let's check it out, then."<br>They walked out through Oskar's building into the next basement corridor, all the way into Tommy's building. As Oskar stood there with a key in his hand, about to unlock the last door, he hesitated. If they were in there? If they caught sight of Eli? If they… it could turn into something he wasn't able to handle. Eli held the plastic sword in front of her. "What is it?"<br>"Nothing."<br>He unlocked the door. As soon as they walked into the corridor he heard music coming from the storage unit. As he turned to her he whispered: "They're here! Come on."<br>Eli stopped, sniffed.<br>"What's that smell?"<br>Oskar checked to make sure that nothing was moving around at the other end of the corridor, then sniffed the air. Couldn't smell anything except the usual basement air. Eli said, "Paint, glue." Oscar sniffed again. He couldn't smell it but he knew what it had to be. When he turned back to Eli to get her to follow him he saw that she was doing something with the lock.<br>"Come on. What are you doing?" I m just…<br>As Oskar was unlocking the door to the next basement corridor, their path of retreat, the door fell shut behind them. It didn't make the normal<br>sound. No click, just a metallic clunk. On the way back to their basement he told Eli about glue-sniffing; how crazy those guys could get when they did that.<br>He felt safe again in his own basement. He knelt down and started to count the bottles in the bag. Fourteen beer bottles and a liquor bottle with no deposit value.<br>When he looked up to report this to Eli she was standing in front of him with the plastic sword held up as if about to attack. Used to sudden blows as he was, he flinched a little. But Eli mumbled something and lowered the sword against his shoulder and said, with as deep a voice as she could muster:<br>"I herewith dub you, Jonny's conqueror, knight of Blackeberg and all surrounding areas like Vallingby… um…"<br>"Racksta."<br>"Racksta."<br>"Maybe Angby?"<br>"Angby maybe."<br>Eli tapped him lightly on the shoulder for each new area. Oskar took his knife out of the bag, held it out, and proclaimed that he was the Knight of Angby Maybe. Wanted Eli to be the Beautiful Maiden he would rescue from the Dragon.<br>But Eli was a terrible monster who ate beautiful maidens for lunch and she was the one he would have to fight. Oskar left the knife in his sheath as they fought, shouted, and ran around in the corridors. In the middle of their game they heard a scrape in the lock to the basement doors.<br>They quickly piled into a food cellar where they hardly had room to sit hip against hip, and breathed quickly and quietly. They heard a man's voice.<br>"What are you doing down here?"<br>Oskar and Eli held their breath as the man waited, listening. Then he said: "Damn kids" and left. They stayed in the food cellar until they were sure the man had gone, then they crawled out, leaned against the wooden wall, giggling. After a while Eli stretched out on the concrete floor and stared up at the ceiling.<br>Oskar touched her foot.<br>"Are you tired?"<br> <br><br>"Yes. Tired."<br>Oskar pulled his knife out of the sheath, looked at it. It was heavy, beautiful. He carefully pressed his pointed finger against the tip, then removed it. A small red dot. He pressed again, harder. When he took his finger away a pearl-shaped drop of blood came out. But this wasn't the way to do it.<br>"Eli? Do you want to do something?"<br>She was still staring up at the ceiling.<br>"What?"<br>"Do you want to… enter into a pact with me?"<br>"Yes."<br>If she had asked him "how?" he would maybe have told her what he was thinking before he did it. But she simply said "yes." She wanted to do it, whatever it was. Oskar swallowed hard, gripped the knife so the edge was resting against the palm of his hand, shut his eyes, and pulled the blade out of his hand. A stinging, smarting pain. He caught his breath.<br>Did I do this?<br>He opened his eyes, opened his hand. Yes. A thin trickle of blood was revealed in his palm. The blood pushed out slowly, not as he had thought in a thin line but as a string of pearls that he stared at with fascination as they merged into a thicker, uneven mass.<br>Eli lifted her head.<br>"What are you doing?"<br>Oskar was still holding his hand in front of his face, staring at it, and said:<br>"It's easy, Eli, it wasn't even…"<br>He held his bleeding hand toward her. Her eyes widened. She shook her head violently while she crawled backward, away from his hand.<br>"No, Oskar…"<br>"What is it?"<br>"Oskar, no."<br>"It almost doesn't hurt at all."<br>Eli stopped backing up, staring at his hand while she kept shaking her head. Oskar was holding the knife by the blade in his other hand, held it out to her handle first.<br>"You only have to prick yourself in a finger or something. Then we'll mix our blood. And then we have our pact."<br>Eli did not take the knife. Oskar put it down on the floor so he could catch a drop of blood that fell from his wound.<br>"Come on. Don't you want to?"<br>"Oskar… we can't. You would be infected, you-"<br>"It doesn't feel like that, it…"<br>A ghost flew into Eli's face, distorting it into something so different from the girl he knew that he completely forgot about catching the blood that dropped from his hand. She now looked like the monster they had recently pretended that she was and Oskar jumped back while the pain in his hand intensified.<br>"Eli, what…"<br>She sat up, pulled her legs under her, crouched on all fours, and stared straight at his bleeding hand, took a step closer toward it. Stopped, clenched her teeth, and got out a gruff: "Leave!"<br>Tears of fear welled up in Oskar's eyes. "Eli, stop it. Stop playing. Stop it."<br>Eli crawled a bit closer, stopped again. She forced her body to contort itself so her head was lowered to the ground and screamed:<br>"Go! Or you'll die!"<br>Oskar got up, took a few steps back. His feet hit against the bag of bottles so it fell over, with a clinking sound. He flattened himself against the wall while Eli crawled over to the little smear of blood that had fallen from his hand.<br>Another bottle fell over and broke against the concrete floor while Oskar stood pressed against the wall and stared at Eli, who stretched out her tongue and licked the dirty concrete, whisked her tongue around on the place where blood had fallen.<br>A bottle clinked softly and stopped moving. Eli licked and licked the floor. When she lifted her face to him there was a gray smear of dirt on the tip of her nose. "Go… please… leave."<br>Then the ghost flew into her face again, but before it had time to take over she got up and ran down the corridor, opened the door to her stairwell, and disappeared.<br>Oskar stood there with the damaged hand tightly wrapped. Blood was starting to well out around the edges. He opened it, looked at the cut. It had gone deeper than he had intended, but it wasn't dangerous, he thought. Some blood was already starting to congeal.<br>He looked at the by-now pale splotch on the floor. Then he gingerly licked a little of the blood on his palm, spit it out.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Night lights.<br>Tomorrow they would operate on his mouth and throat, probably in the hopes that something would come out. His tongue was still there. He could move it around in the sealed cavity of his mouth, tickle his upper jaw with it. Maybe he would be able to talk again even though his lips were gone. But he did not intend to talk again.<br>A woman, he didn't know if she was from the police or a nurse, sat in the corner a few meters away, reading a book and keeping an eye on him.<br>They allot so much of their resources when a nobody decides his life is over?<br>He realized that he was valuable, that he meant a lot to them. Probably they were digging around in old records right now, cases they hoped to be able to solve with him as the perpetrator. A policeman had been in yesterday to take his fingerprints. He had not made any resistance. It didn't matter.<br>It was possible that the fingerprints would link him to the murders in both Vaxjo and Norrkoping. He tried to remember how he had proceeded there, if he had left fingerprints or other traces. Probably.<br>The only thing that worried him was that by way of these events people could track down Eli.<br>People…<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>They had put notes in his mailbox, threatened him.<br>Someone who worked at the post office and who lived in the area had tipped off the other neighbors about what kind of mail, what kind of videos he received.<br>It took about a month before he was fired from his job at the school. You couldn't have someone like that working with children. He had walked away willingly, even though he could probably have brought it up with the union.<br>He hadn't actually done anything at the school; he wasn't that stupid.<br>The campaign against him had increased in strength and finally one night someone had thrown a firebomb through his living room window. He had fled out onto the lawn in only his underpants, stood there and watched his life burn to the ground.<br>The crime investigation dragged on in time and therefore he didn't get the insurance money. With his meager savings he had taken the train, rented a room in Vaxjo. That's where he started working on trying to die.<br>He drank himself down to the level where he used whatever was at hand. Aco acne-solution, T-Rod denatured alcohol. He stole wine-making kits and Turbo yeast from hardware stores and drank everything before it was ready.<br>He was outside as much as possible. In some way he wanted "the people" to see him die, day for day.<br>In his drunken stupor he became careless, fondled young boys, got beaten up, ended up at the police station. Once he sat in jail for three days and puked his guts out. Was released. Kept drinking.<br>One evening when Hakan was sitting on a bench next to a playground with a bottle of half-yeasted wine in a plastic bag, Eli came and sat down beside him. In his drunkenness Hakan had almost immediately put a hand on Eli's thigh. Eli had let it stay there, taken Hakan's head between her hands, turned it toward her, and said: "You are going to be with me."<br>Hakan had mumbled something about how he couldn't afford such a beauty right now but when his finances allowed…<br>Eli had moved his hand from her thigh, leaned down, and taken his wine bottle, poured it out and said: "You don't understand. You're going to stop drinking now. You are going to be with me. You are going to help me. I need you. And I'm going to help you." Then Eli had held out her hand, Hakan had taken it, and they had walked away together.<br>He had stopped drinking and entered into Eli's service.<br>Eli had given him money to buy some clothes and to rent another apartment. He had done everything without wondering whether Eli was<br>"evil" or "good" or anything else. Eli was beautiful and Eli had given him back his dignity. And in rare moments… tenderness.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>The pages rustled when the night guard turned them in the book she was reading. Probably a dime store novel. In Plato's republic the "Guards" were supposed to be the most highly educated among the people. But this was Sweden, 1981, and they were probably reading Jan Guillou.<br>The man in the water, the man whose corpse he had sunk. That had been clumsy of him, of course. He should have done as Eli said and buried him. But nothing about the man would be traced back to Eli. The bite mark in his neck would be regarded as unusual, but they would think the blood had been washed away by the water. The man's clothes were…<br>Her top!<br>Eli's top, the one Hakan had found on the man's body when he first came to take care of it. He should have taken it home with him, burned it, anything.<br>Instead he had tucked it inside the man's coat. How would they interpret that? A child's top, spotted with blood. Was there a risk that someone had seen this shirt on Eli? Someone who would recognize it? If it were displayed in the paper, for example? Someone Eli had met before, someone who…<br>Oskar. The boy next door.<br>Hakan's body twisted restlessly in the bed. The guard put her book down and looked at him.<br>"Don't do anything stupid."<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Eli crossed Bjornsonsgatan, continued into the courtyard between the nine-story buildings, two monolithic lighthouses towering over the crouching three-story buildings scattered around. No one was outside, but there was light coming from the gymnasium and Eli slithered up the fire escape ladder, looked in.<br>Music was blaring out of a small tape player. Middle-aged women<br>were jumping around in time to the music so the wooden floor shook. Eli curled up in the metal grating of the stairs, leaned her chin on her knees, and took in the scene.<br>Several of the women were overweight and their massive breasts were bouncing like cheery bowling balls under their T-shirts. The women jumped and skipped, lifting their knees so the flesh trembled in their too-tight workout pants. They moved in a circle, clapped their hands, jumped again. All the while the music kept going. Warm, oxygenated blood streaming through thirsty muscles.<br>But there were too many of them.<br>Eli jumped down from the fire escape, landed softly on the frozen ground underneath, continued around the back of the gym, and stopped outside the swimming pool.<br>The large frosted windows projected rectangles of light onto the snow cover. Over each large window there was a smaller, narrow window made of regular glass. Eli jumped up and hung from the edge of the roof with her hands, looked in. No one was inside. The surface of the pool glittered in the glow of the halogen lights. A few balls were floating in the middle.<br>Swim. Splash. Play.<br>Eli swayed back and forth, a dark pendulum. Looked at the balls, saw them flying through the air, thrown up again, laughter and screams and splashing water. Eli relaxed her hold on the edge of the roof, fell down, and consciously let herself land so hard that it hurt, then kept going over the school yard to the path through the park, stopping under a high tree hanging over the path. It was dark. No one around. Eli looked up into the top of the tree, along five six meters of smooth tree trunk. Kicked off her shoes. Thought herself new hands, new feet.<br>It hardly hurt at all anymore, just felt like a tingling, an electric current through her fingers and toes as they thinned out, took on a new shape. The bones crackled in her hands as they stretched out, shot out through the melting skin of the fingertips and made long, curved claws. Same thing with her toes.<br>Eli jumped a couple of meters up onto the trunk of the tree, dug in her claws, and climbed up to a thick branch that hung out over the path. Curled the claws on her feet around the branch and sat without moving.<br>A shooting sensation in her teeth as Eli thought them sharp. The enamel bulged out, was sharpened by an invisible file, became sharp. Eli carefully bit herself in her lower lip, a crescent-shaped row of needles that almost punctured the skin. Now only the wait.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>It was close to ten and the temperature in the room was approaching the unbearable. Two bottles of vodka had already been consumed, a new one had been taken out, and everyone agreed that Gosta was one hell of a guy and his kindness wouldn't count for nothing.<br>Only Virginia had been taking it easy, since she had to get up and work the next day. She also seemed to be the only one who was affected by the air in the room. The already damp smell of cat piss and stale air was now mixed with smoke, alcohol fumes, and the perspiration of six bodies.<br>Lacke and Gosta were still sitting on either side of her on the couch, now only half conscious. Gosta was petting a cat on his lap, a cat who was wall-eyed, something which had caused Morgan to have such fits of laughter that he had hit his head on the table and then had a shot of pure alcohol in order to dull the pain.<br>Lacke wasn't saying much. He mostly sat staring straight ahead, his eyes glazed over with haziness, then mist and fog. His lips moved soundlessly from time to time as if he were conversing with a ghost.<br>Virginia got up and walked over to the window. "Is it OK if I open this?"<br>Gosta shook his head.<br>"The cats… can… jump out."<br>"But I'll stand here and keep watch."<br>Gosta kept shaking his head mechanically and Virginia opened the window. Air! She greedily took a couple of lungfuls of fresh air and immediately felt better. Lacke, who had been starting to slip sideways in the couch since Virginia's support was no longer available, straightened up and said out loud:<br>"A friend! A real… friend!"<br>A mumble of agreement from around the room. Everyone knew he was talking about Jocke. Lacke stared into the empty glass in his hand and continued:<br>"You have one friend… who never lets you down. And that is worth everything. Do you hear that? Everything. And you have to get that me and Jocke were… like this!"<br>He made his hand into a tight fist, shook it in front of his face.<br>"And nothing can replace that. Nothing! You're all sitting here yammering about 'what a damn good guy' and all that but you… you're all empty. Hollow. I have nothing now that Jocke… is gone. Nothing. So don't talk about loss with me, don't talk about…"<br>Virginia stood next to the window, listening. She walked up to Lacke in order to remind him of her existence. Crouched down next to his knee and tried to catch his eye and said: "Lacke."<br>"No! Don't come here and… 'Lacke, Lacke'… this is just the way it is. You don't get it. You're… cold. You go downtown and pick up some damn truck driver or whatever, take him home, and let him screw you when you get down. That's what you do. Damn… trucking caravan is what you have going on. But a friend… a friend…"<br>Virginia stood up with tears in her eyes, slapped Lacke, and ran out of the apartment. Lacke lost his balance in the couch and hit Gosta in the shoulder. Gosta mumbled: "The window… the window."<br>Morgan closed it and said: "Well done, Lacke. That was a good one. You probably won't see any more of her."<br>Lacke stood up and walked with unsteady legs over to Morgan, who cast an eye out the window. "What the hell, I didn't mean to…"<br>"No, of course not. Go tell her instead."<br>Morgan nodded down at the ground where Virginia had just come out of the front door of the building, and was walking rapidly with a lowered gaze toward the park. Lacke heard what he had said. His last words to her stuck inside his head like an echo. Did I say that? He turned on his heel and hurried to the door.<br>"I just have to…"<br>Morgan nodded. "Hurry up. And give her my regards."<br>Lacke threw himself down the stairs as fast as his trembling legs could carry him. The speckle-patterned stairs were nothing but a shimmer before his eyes and the banister slid so quickly through his hand it started to sting from the heat of the friction. He tripped on a landing, fell, and hit his elbow hard. The arm filled with heat and became sort of paralyzed. He got up and stumbled on down the stairs. He was rushing to help save a life. His own.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Virginia walked away from the building, down to the park, and did not turn around.<br>Her body was wracked with sobs, half-running as if to outrun the tears. But they followed her, forced themselves into her eyes, and fell in big drops down her cheeks. Her heels cut through the snow, clicking against the asphalt of the path, and she wound her arms around herself, hugging herself.<br>There was no one to be seen so she gave in freely to her sobs as she made her way home, pressed her arms against her stomach; the pain lodged in there like an ill-tempered fetus.<br>Let a person in and he hurts you.<br>There was a reason why she kept her relationships brief. Don't let them in. Once they're inside they have more potential to hurt you. Comfort yourself. You can live with the anguish as long as it only involves yourself. As long as there is no hope.<br>But with Lacke she had held out hope. That something would slowly grow up between them. And in the end. One day. What? He accepted her food and her warmth but in reality she meant nothing to him.<br>She walked huddled-up along the path, doubled over with sorrow. Her back was stooped and it was as if a demon sat there whispering terrible things in her ear.<br>Never again. Nothing.<br>Just as she was starting to imagine what this demon looked like, it landed on top of her.<br>A heavy weight struck her in the back and she fell helplessly to the side. Her cheek met snow and the film of tears was transformed into ice. The weight remained.<br>For one second she really believed it was the sorrow-demon who had taken a physical form and thrown itself on top of her. Then she felt the<br>searing pain in her throat as sharp teeth penetrated the skin. She managed to get back on her feet, spinning around and trying to get rid of the thing that was on top of her.<br>There was something chewing on her neck, her throat; a stream of blood ran down between her breasts. She screamed at the top of her lungs and tried to shake off the creature on her back, kept screaming as she fell again onto the snow.<br>Until something hard was laid over her mouth. A hand.<br>Against her cheek there were claws digging into the soft flesh… all the way in until they reached the cheekbone.<br>The teeth stopped chewing and she heard a sound like the one you make with a straw as you suck up the dregs in the glass. Liquid flowed over one eye and she didn't know if it was tears or blood.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>When Lacke came out of the apartment building Virginia was nothing more than a dark shape moving down the path toward Arvid Mornes. His chest was hurting from sprinting down the stairs and his elbow sent waves of pain toward the shoulder. In spite of all this, he ran. He ran as fast as he could. His head was starting to clear in the cool air, and fear of losing her drove him on.<br>When he reached the bend in the path where "Jocke's path"-as he had started to call it-met "Virginia's path" he stopped, drew as much air into his lungs as he could in order to shout out her name. She was walking up ahead only fifty meters away.<br>Just as he was about to call out her name he saw a shadow fall from a tree above Virginia, land on her, and knock her to the ground. His scream turned into a hiss, and he sped up. He wanted to shout something but there was not enough air to both run and shout.<br>He ran.<br>In front of him Virginia got to her feet with a large lump on her back, spun around like a crazed hunchback, and fell down again.<br>He had no plan, no thoughts. Nothing except this: to get to Virginia and get rid of whatever that was on her back. She lay in the snow next to the path with that black mass crawling on her.<br>When he reached her he directed all of his force into a kick at the black thing. His foot made contact with something hard and he heard a sharp crack, as when ice breaks up. The black thing was thrown from Virginia's back and landed in the snow next to her.<br>Virginia lay completely still; there were dark stains on the white ground. The black thing sat up.<br>A child.<br>Lacke stood there staring into the prettiest little child's face imaginable, framed by a veil of black hair. A pair of enormous dark eyes met his.<br>The child got up on all fours, cat-like, preparing to lunge. The face changed as the child drew back its lips and Lacke could see the rows of sharp teeth glow in the dark.<br>They remained like this for a few panting breaths, the child on all fours, and Lacke could now see that its fingers were claws, sharply defined against the snow.<br>Then a grimace of pain contorted the child's face, she got up on two legs and ran off in the direction of the school with long rapid steps. A few seconds later she reached the shadows and was gone.<br>Lacke stood where he was and blinked away the sweat running into his eyes. Then he threw himself down next to Virginia. He saw the wound. Her whole throat was ripped up. Dark strands of blood ran all the way up into her hair, down her back. He stripped off his jacket, pulled off the sweater he was wearing underneath, bunched it up into a ball, and pressed it against the wound.<br>"Virginia! Virginia! My darling, beloved…"<br>At last he was able to get the words out.<br> <br><br>Saturday 7 November<br> <br><br>On his way to Dad's house. Every bend in the road familiar; he had taken this route… how many times? Alone, maybe only ten or twelve, with his mom maybe another thirty, at least. His mom and dad had divorced when he was four, but Oskar and his mom had kept coming out on weekends and holidays.<br>The last three years he had been allowed to take the bus by himself. This time his mom hadn't even come with him to the Tekniska Hogskolan stop where the buses left. He was a big boy now, had his own book of prepaid tickets to the subway in his wallet.<br>Actually the main reason he had the wallet was to have a place to keep the prepaid tickets but now there was also twenty kronor to buy sweets and such, as well as the notes from Eli.<br>Oskar fiddled with the Band-Aid on his palm. He didn't want to see her anymore. She was scary. What happened in the basement was-<br>She showed her true face.<br>– there was something in her, something that was… Pure Horror. Everything you were supposed to watch out for. Heights, fire, shards of glass, snakes. Everything that his mom tried so hard to keep him safe from.<br>Maybe that was why he hadn't wanted Eli and his mom to meet. His mom would have recognized it, forbidden him to get near it. Near Eli.<br>The bus exited the freeway and turned down toward Spillersboda. This was the only bus that went to Radmanso Island. That was why it had to wind its way up and down all the roads-in order to drive through as many settlements as possible. The bus drove past the mountainous landscape of piled timber at the Spillersboda Sawmill, made a sharp turn and almost slid on its back down toward the pier.<br>He had not waited for Eli Friday evening.<br>Instead he had taken the Snow Racer and gone by himself to Ghost Hill. His mom had protested since he had stayed home from school that day with a cold, but he said he felt better.<br>He walked through China Park with the Snow Racer on his back. The sledding hill started a hundred meters past the last park lights, a hundred meters of dark forest. The snow crunched under his feet. There was a soft soughing from the forest, like breathing. The moonlight filtered through the trees and the ground between them turned into a woven tapestry of shadows where figures without faces waited, swaying to and fro.<br>He reached the place where the path started to bear down strongly toward Kvarnviken Bay, and climbed onto his Snow Racer. The Ghost House was a black wall next to the hill, a reprimand: You are not allowed to be here in the dark. This is our place now. If you want to play here, you'll have to play with us.<br>At the bottom of the hill he could see the occasional light shining<br>from the Kvarnviken boat club. Oskar inched himself forward a few centimeters, the incline took over, and the Snow Racer started to glide. He squeezed the steering wheel, wanted to close his eyes but didn't dare to because then he could veer off the road and down the steep slope toward the Ghost House.<br>He shot down the hill, a projectile of nerves and tensed muscles. Faster, faster. Formless, snow-covered arms stretched out from the Ghost House, grabbing for his hat, brushing against his cheek.<br>Maybe it was only a sudden gust of wind but at the very bottom of the hill he drove into a viscous, transparent, filmy barrier stretched out over the path that tried to stop him. But his speed was too great.<br>The Snow Racer drove into the filmy barrier and it glued itself onto his face and body, was stretched until it burst, and then he was through.<br>The lights were glittering over Kvarnviken Bay. He sat on his Snow Racer and stared out over the spot where he had knocked down Jonny yesterday morning. Turned around. The Ghost House was an ugly shack of sheet metal.<br>He pulled the Snow Racer up the hill again. Slid down. Up again. Down again. Couldn't stop. And he went on. Went on until his face was a mask of ice.<br>Then he walked home.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>He had only slept four or five hours, afraid that Eli was going to come. Of what he would be forced to say, to do if she did that. Push her away. Therefore he fell asleep on the bus to Norrtalje and didn't wake up until they were there. On the Radmanso bus he had kept himself awake, made a game out of trying to remember as much as possible along the way.<br>Soon there will be a yellow house with a windmill on the lawn.<br>A yellow house with a snowy windmill on the lawn passed by outside the window. And so on. In Spillersboda a girl got on the bus. Oskar gripped the back of the seat in front of him. She looked a little like Eli. Of course it wasn't her. The girl sat down a few seats in front of him. He looked at her neck.<br>What's wrong with her?<br>The thought had come to him even as he was in the cellar gathering the bottles together and wiping the blood away with a piece of cloth from the garbage: that Eli was a vampire. That explained a lot of things.<br>That she was never out in the daytime.<br>That she could see in the dark; he had come to understand that she could.<br>Plus a lot of other things: the way she talked, the cube, her flexibility, things that of course could have a natural explanation… but then there was also the way that she had licked his blood from the floor, and what really made him shiver was when he thought about the:<br>"Can I come in? Say that I can come in."<br>That she had needed an invitation to come into his room, to his bed. And he had invited her in. A vampire. A being that lived off other peoples' blood. Eli. There was not one person who he could tell. No one would believe him. And if someone did believe him, what would happen?<br>Oskar imagined a caravan of men walking through Blackeberg, in through the covered entrance where he and Eli had hugged, with sharpened stakes in their hands. He was afraid of Eli now, didn't want to see her anymore, but he didn't want that.<br>Three quarters of an hour after he had boarded the bus in Norrtalje he arrived in Sodersvik. He pulled on the string and the bell rang up front by the driver. The bus pulled over right in front of the store and he had to wait for an old lady, whom he recognized but didn't know the name of, to get off.<br>His dad was standing below the stairs, nodded and said "hum" to the old lady. Oskar climbed off the bus, stood still for a second in front of his dad. This last week things had happened that had made Oskar feel bigger. Not adult. But bigger, at any rate. All that fell away as he stood in front of his father.<br>His mom claimed his dad was childlike, in a bad way. Immature, couldn't handle responsibility. Oh, she said some nice things about him too, but that was what she always came back to. The immaturity.<br>For Oskar, his dad was the very image of an adult as he now stretched out his broad arms and Oskar fell into them.<br>His dad smelled different from all the people in the city. In his torn Helly Hansen vest fixed with Velcro there was always the same mixture of<br>wood, paint, metal, and above all, oil. These were the smells but Oskar didn't think of them in that way. It was all simply "Dad's smell." He loved it and drew a deep breath through his nose as he pressed his face against his dad's chest.<br>"Well hey there."<br>"Hi Dad."<br>"Your trip go OK?"<br>"No, we ran into an elk."<br>"Oh no. That must have been something."<br>"Just joking."<br>"I see. I see. But you know, I remember a time…"<br>As they walked toward the store, Dad started telling a story about how once a truck he was driving had collided with an elk. Oskar had heard the story before and looked around, humming from time to time.<br>The Sodervik store looked as trashy as ever. Signs and streamers that had been allowed to stay up in anticipation of next summer made the whole store look like an oversized ice cream stand. The large tent behind the store, where they sold garden tools, soil, outdoor furniture, and such, was tied up for the season.<br>In summer the population of Sodervik increased four-fold. The whole area down toward Norrtaljeviken Bay, Lagaro, was an unruly conglomeration of summer houses, and even though the mailboxes down toward Lagaro were hung in double rows of thirty, the mailman almost never had to go there at this time of year. No people, no mail.<br>Just as they reached the moped his dad finished the story with the elk.<br>"… and then I had to hit him with a crowbar that I had for opening drawers and that kind of thing. Right between the eyes. He twitched like this and… yes. No, it wasn't so nice."<br>"No, of course not."<br>Oskar jumped up on the trailer, pulling his legs in under him. His dad dug around in a pocket on the vest and pulled out a cap.<br>"Here. It'll get cold around your ears."<br>"No, I have one."<br>Oskar took out his own cap and put it on. Dad put the other one away.<br>"What about you? It'll get cold around your ears."<br>Dad laughed.<br>"No, I'm used to it."<br>Of course Oskar knew that; he was just teasing. He couldn't remember ever seeing his dad in a wool cap. If it got really cold and windy he put on a kind of bearskin hat with ear flaps that he called his "inheritance," but that was the limit.<br>His dad kick-started the moped and it roared like an electric chain saw. He shouted something about the idling and put it in first. The moped jumped forward, almost causing Oskar to fall backwards; his dad yelled something about the gears and then they were off.<br>Second, third gear. The moped flew through the town. Oskar sat with his legs crossed in the clattering trailer. He felt like a king of the world and would have been able to keep going like this forever.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>A physician had explained it to him. The fumes he had inhaled had burned away his vocal chords and he would probably never be able to speak normally again. A new operation would be able to give him a rudimentary ability to produce vowels, but since even his tongue and lips were badly injured there would have to be additional operations to enable the possibility of uttering consonants.<br>As a former Swedish teacher Hakan could not help but be fascinated at the thought: to create speech by surgical means.<br>He knew quite a bit about phonemes and the smallest components of language, common across many cultures. He had never reflected much over the actual tools of production-the roof of the mouth, lips, tongue, vocal chords-in this way. To coax speech from this shapeless raw material with a scalpel.<br>But it was meaningless anyway. He did not intend to speak. In addition, he suspected that the doctor was talking that way for a special reason. He was considered suicide-prone. Therefore it was important to imprint him with a linear sense of time. To recreate the feeling of life as a project, a dream of future conquests.<br>He didn't buy it.<br>If Eli needed him he could consider living. Otherwise he could not. Nothing indicated that Eli needed him.<br>But how would Eli be able to contact him in this place?<br>From the tree tops outside his window he sensed that he was high up. And furthermore, he was well-guarded. In addition to the doctors and nurses there was always at least one policeman nearby. Eli could not reach him and he could not reach Eli. The thought of escaping, of getting in touch with Eli one last time had gone through his head. But how?<br>The throat operation had made him capable of breathing on his own again. He no longer had to be attached to a respirator. But he could not get down food in the normal way (even this would be repaired, the doctor had assured him). The feeding tube dangled constantly at the edge of his vision. If he pulled it out an alarm would go off somewhere, and anyway he couldn't see very well. To escape was basically unthinkable.<br>A plastic surgeon had taken the opportunity to transplant a piece of skin from his back to his eyelid so he could shut his eye.<br>He shut his eye.<br>The door to his room opened. It was time again. He recognized the voice. The same man as before.<br>"Well, well," said the man. "They tell me there won't be any talking in the near future. That's too bad. But I have this stubborn thought that we could still manage to communicate with each other, you and me, if you're up for it."<br>Hakan tried to remember what Plato said in The Republic about murderers and violent offenders, what you were supposed to do with them.<br>"I see you can shut your eye now. That's good. You know what? I'll try to make this a little more concrete for you. Because it struck me that maybe you don't believe we're going to identify you. But we will. I'm sure you remember you had a wristwatch. Luckily it was an older watch with the manufacturer's initials, serial number, and everything. We're going to trace it within a couple of days, in one way or another. A week maybe. And there are other things.<br>"We'll find you, that's a certainty.<br>"So… Max. I don't know why I want to call you Max, it is entirely provisional. Max? You maybe want to help us out a little here. Otherwise we'll have to take a picture of you and send it to the papers and… well, you see. It will be… complicated. Much easier if you talk… or something… with me now.<br>"You had a piece of paper with the Morse code in your pocket. Do you know the Morse code? Because in that case we can talk by tapping."<br>Hakan opened his eye, looked in the direction of the two dark spots in the white, blurry oval that was the man's face. The man clearly chose to interpret this as an invitation. He continued.<br>"This man in the water. It wasn't you who killed him, was it? The pathologists say that the bite marks in his neck were probably made by a child. And now we've had a report that I unfortunately can't give any details of, but… I think you are protecting someone. Is this correct? Lift your hand if this is correct."<br>Hakan shut his eye. The policeman sighed.<br>"OK, then we'll let the machine keep working. Is there anything else you would like to tell me before I go?"<br>The man was about to get up when Hakan lifted one hand. The policeman sat down again. Hakan lifted the hand higher. And waved.<br>Good-bye.<br>The policeman let out a snorting sound, got up, and left.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Virginia's injuries had not been life-threatening. On Friday afternoon she was discharged from the hospital with fourteen stitches and a large bandage on her neck, a smaller one on her cheek. She had refused Lacke's offer to stay with her, live with her, until she felt better.<br>She had gone to bed Friday evening convinced that she would get up and go to work Saturday morning. Couldn't afford to stay home.<br>It had been hard to fall asleep. Memories of the attack kept returning, and she couldn't get settled. Thought she saw black lumps emerge out of the shadows of her room and fall down on her as she lay in bed with her eyes wide open. Her wound itched under the bandage on her throat. Around two o'clock in the morning she got hungry, went out into the kitchen, and opened the refrigerator.<br>Her stomach had felt empty, but as she stood there and looked at all the food, there was nothing she felt she wanted. From habit, she had still taken out the bread, butter, cheese, and milk and set them on the kitchen table.<br>She made herself a cheese sandwich and poured milk into a glass. Then she sat at the table and looked at the white liquid in the glass, the brown piece of bread with its yellow slice of cheese. It looked revolting. She didn't want it. She threw it out, pouring the milk down the drain. There was a half-full bottle of white wine in the fridge. She poured out a glass, brought it to her lips. But when she smelled the wine she lost interest.<br>With a feeling of failure she poured herself a glass of water from the tap. She hesitated as she brought it to her mouth. Surely you could always drink water?… Yes. She could drink the water. But it tasted… stale. As if everything good in the water had been removed and only left the flat dregs.<br>She went back to bed, shifting restlessly for a few more hours then finally falling asleep.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>When she woke up it was half past ten. She threw herself out of bed, pulled on some clothes in the dimly lit bedroom. Good heavens. She should have been at the store at eight. Why hadn't they called?<br>Oh, but wait. She had heard the phone ring. It had rung in her last dream before she woke up, then stopped. If they hadn't called she would still be sleeping. She buttoned her blouse and walked over to the window, pulled up the blinds.<br>The light struck her face like a physical blow. She staggered backward, away from the window, and dropped the cords to the blinds. They slipped down again with a clattering sound, stopping at a crooked angle. She sat down on the bed. A single beam of sunlight came in through the window, shining on her naked foot.<br>A thousand pinpricks.<br>As if her skin were being twisted in two directions at once.<br>What is this?<br>She moved her foot away, pulled on her socks. Moved her foot back into the sunlight. Better. Only a hundred pinpricks. She stood up to go to work then sat down again.<br>Some kind of… shock.<br>The sensation when she pulled up the blinds had been ghastly. As if the light were heavy matter flung at her body, pushing her away. It had been the worst in the eyes. Two strong thumbs pressing on them, threatening to gouge them out of her head. They were still stinging.<br>She rubbed her eyes with the palms of her hands, took her sunglasses out of the bathroom cabinet and put them on.<br>Hunger raged in her body but all she had to do was think of the contents of the refrigerator and pantry to make all thoughts of eating breakfast disappear. And anyway she had no time. She was almost three hours late.<br>She went out, locked the door, and walked down the stairs as fast as she could. Her body was weak. Maybe it was a mistake to go to work today. Well, the store would only be open four more hours and it was now the Saturday customers started to come in.<br>She was so preoccupied with these thoughts that she did not hesitate before opening the front door of the building.<br>The light was there again.<br>Her eyes hurt despite the sunglasses, boiling water was poured over her hands and face. She gave a little scream. Pulled her hands into her coat, bent her face to the ground and ran. She could not protect her neck and scalp and they stung like they were on fire. Luckily it was not far to the store.<br>When she was safely inside, the stinging and pain quickly lifted. Most of the store windows were covered in advertising and protective plastic film so that the sunlight wouldn't affect the goods. She took off her sunglasses. It hurt a little, but that could be because a little bit of sunlight came in the spaces between the advertising posters. She put her sunglasses in her pocket and walked out to the office.<br>Lennart, the store manager and her boss, was there filling out forms, but he looked up when she came in. She had expected some kind of reprimand but he simply said: "Hi, how's it going."<br>"Oh… fine."<br>"Shouldn't you be at home getting some rest?"<br>"No, I thought…"<br>"You didn't need to, you know. Lotten will fill in for you today. I tried to call you earlier, but when you didn't pick up…"<br>"Isn't there anything for me to do, then?"<br>"Check with Berit in the meat department. And Virginia…"<br>"Yes."<br>"I'm sorry about what happened. I don't know exactly how to say it, but… I feel badly about it. And I completely understand if you need to take it easy for a while."<br>Virginia couldn't get her head around it. Lennart was not the kind of person who looked kindly on sick leave, or for that matter, any kind of problem that other people might have. And to hear him extend his personal sympathies was something completely new. She must look pretty terrible with her swollen cheek and her bandages.<br>Virginia said: "Thanks. I'll think it over," and went to the meat department.<br>She looped over past the checkout registers in order to say hi to Lot-ten. Five people were lined up at her register and Virginia thought she should open another one after all. But the question was if Lennart even wanted her to sit at a checkout register looking as she did.<br>When she walked into the light from the horrible window behind the checkout registers it got like that again. Her face tightened, her eyes ached. It wasn't as bad as the direct sunlight out on the street, but it was bad enough. She would not be able to sit there.<br>Lotten caught sight of her, waved in between two customers.<br>"Hi, I read… How are you doing?"<br>Virginia held up her hand, wiggled it from side to side: so so.<br>Read?<br>She nabbed the Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter, took them with her over to the meat department, quickly eyed the first page news. Nothing there. That would have been a reach.<br>The meat department was at the very back of the store, beside the milk products, strategically planned so that you had to walk through the whole store in order to get there. Virginia stopped next to the shelves with canned food. She was trembling with hunger. She looked carefully at all the cans.<br>Crushed tomatoes, mushrooms, mussels, tuna, ravioli, Bullen's beer sausage, pea soup… no. She felt nothing but revulsion.<br>Berit saw her from the meat counter, waved. As soon as Virginia had come around the back of the counter Berit hugged her, and carefully touched the bandage on her cheek.<br>"Ugh. Poor you."<br>"Oh, it's…"<br>Fine?<br>She retreated to the little storage room behind the meat counter. If she let Berit get started she would be subject to a long harangue about people's suffering in general and the evils of today's society in particular.<br>Virginia sat down on a chair between the scales and the door to the freezer room. It was an area of only a few square meters but it was the most comfortable place in the store. No sunlight. She flipped through the papers and found a small article in the Dagens Nyheter domestic news section. She read:<br>Woman attacked in Blackeberg<br>A fifty-year-old woman unknown. The police are now was attacked and assaulted investigating a possible con-Thursday night in the Stock- nection to other violent inci-holm suburb of Blackeberg. A dents in the western suburbs passerby intervened and the during the past few weeks. The perpetrator, a young woman, fifty-year-old woman's injuries immediately fled the scene, were described as minor. The motive of the assault is<br>Virginia lowered the paper. So strange to read about yourself in that way. "Fifty-year-old woman," "passerby" "minor injuries." Everything that was concealed by those words.<br>"Possible connection?" Yes, Lacke was convinced that she had been attacked by the same child who killed Jocke. He had had to bite his tongue not to say this at the hospital, some time on Friday morning, to the female police officer and the doctor who examined her wounds.<br>He was planning to talk to the police, but wanted to inform Gosta first, thought Gosta would see the whole thing from a new perspective now that even Virginia had been involved.<br>She heard a rustling sound and looked around. It took a few seconds before she realized that it was the newspaper shaking in her own hands that was making the noise. She set the newspapers on the shelf above the white coats and went out to join Berit.<br>"Anything I can do?"<br>"Do you really think it's a good idea, hon?"<br>"Yes, it's better for me to be doing something."<br>"I see. You can portion out the shrimp, in that case. Five hundred gram bags. But shouldn't you?…"<br>Virginia shook her head and walked back to the storage room. She put on a white coat and hat, took a case of shrimp out of the freezer, pulled a plastic bag over her hand, and started to weigh them out. Dug around in the carton with the hand that had the plastic bag over it, portioned them out into bags, weighed them on the scales. A boring, mechanical job, and her right hand felt frozen already on her fourth bag. But she was doing something, and it gave her an opportunity to think.<br>That night at the hospital Lacke had said something really strange: that the child who attacked her had not been a human being. That it had had fangs and claws.<br>Virginia had dismissed this as a drunken hallucination.<br>She didn't remember much from the attack. But she could accept this: the thing that had jumped on top of her had been much too light to be an adult, almost too light to be a child, even. A very small child in that case. Five or six maybe. She recalled that she had stood up with the weight on her back. After that everything was black until she woke up in her apartment with all the guys except Gosta gathered around her.<br>She put a tie around a finished bag, took out the next one, dropped in a few handfuls. Four hundred and thirty grams. Seven more shrimp. Five hundred and ten.<br>Our treat.<br>She looked down at her hands, which were working independently of her brain. Hands. With long nails. Sharp teeth. What was that called? Lacke had said it out loud. A vampire. Virginia had laughed, carefully, so that the stitches in her cheek wouldn't come out. Lacke had not even smiled.<br>"You didn't see it."<br>"But Lacke… they don't really exist."<br>"No. But what was it then?"<br>"A child. Living out a strange twisted fantasy."<br>"Who grew out her nails? Filed her teeth down? I'd like to see the dentist who…"<br>"Lacke, it was dark. You were drunk, it-"<br>"It was, and I was. But I saw what I saw."<br>It burned and felt tight under the bandage on her cheek. She removed the plastic bag from her right hand, put her hand over the bandage. It was ice cold and that felt good. But she was weak; it felt as if her legs weren't going to carry her much longer.<br>She would finish this carton and then go home. This wasn't going to work. If she could rest over the weekend she would probably feel better on Monday. She put the plastic bag back on and started in on the work again with a spark of anger. Hated being sick.<br>A sharp pain in her index finger. Damn it. That's what happens if you don't concentrate. The shrimp were sharp when they were frozen and she had pricked her finger. She pulled off the plastic bag and looked at the finger. A smallish cut with a little blood welling out of it.<br>She automatically popped it into her mouth to suck the blood away.<br>A warm, healing, delicious spot radiating out from the place where her fingertip met her tongue, started to spread. She sucked harder on the finger. All good tastes concentrated into one filled her mouth. A shiver of well-being went through her body. She sucked and sucked, giving in to the pleasure until she realized what she was doing.<br>She pulled the finger out of her mouth, stared at it. It was shiny with saliva and the tiny amount of blood that now welled out was immediately thinned out by the wetness, like an overly diluted watercolor. She looked at the shrimp in the carton. Hundreds of pink bodies, covered with frost. And eyes. Black pinheads dispersed in the white and pink, an upside-down starry sky. Patterns, constellations started to dance in front of her eyes.<br>The world spun on its axis and something hit her in the back of the head. In front of her eyes there was a white surface with cobwebs in the corners. She understood that she was lying on the floor but had no strength to do anything about it.<br>In the distance she heard Berit's voice: "Oh my God… Virginia…"<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Jonny liked to hang out with his older brother. At least when none of his sketchy buddies were around. Jimmy knew some guys from Racksta that<br>Jonny was pretty scared of. One evening a few years ago they had come by to talk to Jimmy, hanging around outside but without ringing the buzzer. When Jonny told them Jimmy wasn't home they asked him to deliver a message.<br>"Tell your brother that if he doesn't get us the dough by Monday we'll put his head in a vice… you know what that is?… OK… and turn it like this until the dough runs out of his ears. Can you tell him that? OK, great. Jonny's your name? Good-bye then, Jonny."<br>Jonny had delivered the message and Jimmy had simply nodded, said he knew. Then some money had disappeared from Mom's wallet and then there had been an angry scene.<br>Jimmy was not home as often nowadays. There was sort of no room for him anymore since their youngest little sister was born. Jonny already had two younger siblings and there weren't supposed to be any more. But then Mom had met some guy and… well… that's how it went.<br>At least Jonny and Jimmy had the same dad. He worked on an oil rig off the coast of Norway and not only had he started sending regular child support, he was also sending a little extra just to make up for before. Mom blessed him, and when she was drunk she had even cried over him a few times and said she would never again meet a man like that. So for the first time in as long as Jonny could remember a lack of money was not the constant topic of conversation.<br>Now they were sitting in the pizzeria on the main square in Blacke-berg. Jimmy had been home in the morning, argued a bit with Mom, and then he and Jonny had gone out. Jimmy heaped condiments on his pizza, folded it up, picked up the large roll with both hands, and started to eat. Jonny ate his pizza in the usual way, thinking that next time he ate pizza without Jimmy he would eat it like that.<br>Jimmy chewed, nodded his head at the bandage over Jonny's ear. "Looks like hell."<br>"Yes."<br>"Does it hurt?"<br>"It's OK."<br>"Mom said it's damaged for life. That you won't be able to hear anything."<br>"They don't know yet. Maybe it'll be alright."<br>"Hm. Let me get this straight. The guy just picked up some big branch and bashed it into your head."<br>"Mm."<br>"Damn. What are you going to do about it?"<br>"Don't know."<br>"Need any help?"<br>"… No."<br>"What? Me and a few of my pals can take him out."<br>Jonny pulled off a big piece with shrimp, his favorite, put it in his mouth and chewed. No. Better not drag Jimmy's friends into this, then it would get out of hand. Nonetheless Jonny smiled at the thought of how scared shitless Oskar would be if he appeared at his house with Jimmy and, say, those guys from Racksta. He shook his head.<br>Jimmy put his pizza roll down and looked seriously at Jonny.<br>"OK, but I'm just saying. One more thing, and then…"<br>He snapped his fingers hard, then made a fist.<br>"You're my brother and no little shit is going to come and… One more thing, then you can say whatever you like. Then I'm going after him. OK?"<br>Jimmy held out his fist across the table. Jonny also made a fist and bumped Jimmy's with it. It felt good. That there was someone who cared. Jimmy nodded.<br>"Good. I have something for you."<br>He bent down under the table, took out a plastic bag that he had been carrying all morning. He drew a thin photo album out of the bag. "Dad came by last week. He's grown a beard, almost didn't recognize him. He had this with him."<br>Jimmy held the album out to Jonny, who wiped his fingers on a napkin and opened it.<br>Pictures of children. Of Mom. Maybe ten years ago. And a man he recognized as his father. The man was pushing the kids on swings. In one picture he was wearing a much-too-small cowboy hat. Jimmy, maybe nine years old, was standing next to him with a plastic rifle in his hands and a grim expression. A little boy who had to be Jonny sat on the ground nearby and looked wide-eyed at them.<br>"He loaned me this till next time. He wants it back, said it was… yeah,<br>what the fuck was it… 'my most valuable possession,' I think he said. Thought it might interest you too."<br>Jonny nodded without looking up from the album. He had only met his dad two times since he left when Jonny was four. At home there was one picture of him, a pretty bad one where he was sitting around with some other people. This was something completely different. Here you could kind of construct a real image of him.<br>"One more thing. Don't show it to Mom. I think Dad kind of swiped it when he left and if she sees it… well, he wants it back, as I told you. Promise. Don't show Mom."<br>Still with his nose buried in the album, Jonny made a fist and held it out over the table. Jimmy laughed and then Jonny felt Jimmy's knuckles against his. Promise.<br>"Hey, you check it out later. Take the bag too."<br>Jimmy held out the bag and Jonny reluctantly folded up the album, put it in the bag. Jimmy was done with his pizza, leaned back in his chair, and patted his stomach.<br>"So. How are things on the chick front?"<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>The village flew by. Snow that was kicked up by the wheels of the moped trailer was sprayed back and peppered Oskar's cheeks. He gripped the towrope with both hands, shifted his weight to the side, swinging out of the snow cloud. There was a sharp scraping sound as the skis sliced through the loose snow. The outer ski nudged an orange reflector where the road split in two. He wobbled, then regained his balance.<br>The road down to Lagaro and the summer houses wasn't plowed. The moped left three deep tracks in the untouched snow cover, and five meters behind it came Oskar on skis, making two additional tracks. He drove zigzag over the moped tracks, stood on one ski like a trick skier, crouched down into a little ball of speed.<br>When his dad slowed down on the long hill heading down to the old steamship pier, Oskar was going faster than the moped and he was forced to brake a little in order not to let too much slack into the line, which would then result in a strong jerk when the hill leveled off and the moped picked up speed again.<br>The moped got all the way down to the pier and his dad switched down out of gear and stood on the brake. Oskar was still traveling at full throttle and for a short moment he thought about dropping the rope and keeping going… Out over the end of the pier, down into the black water. But he angled the mini-skis out, braked a couple of meters from the edge.<br>He stood panting for a while, looked out over the water. Thin sections of ice had started to form, bobbed up and down in the small waves by the shores. Maybe there was a chance of real ice this year. So you could walk across to Vato on the other side. Or did they keep a channel in to Nor-rtalje open? Oskar couldn't remember. It was several years since there had been ice like that.<br>When Oskar was out here in the summer he would fish for herring from this pier. Loose hooks on the line, a lure on the end. If he found a school he could end up with a couple of kilos if he had the patience, but mostly he ended up with ten or fifteen fish. That was enough for dinner for him and his dad; the smallest ones went to the cat.<br>Dad came up and stood behind him.<br>"That went well, it did."<br>"Mmm. But I went all the way through the snow a couple of times."<br>"True, the snow is a little loose. If we could pack it tighter, somehow. If we could… maybe take a particleboard and hitch it up, put some weight on it. You know, if you put the board and the weight down, then…"<br>"Should we do it?"<br>"No, it'd have to be tomorrow, at any rate. It's getting dark now. We'll have to get home and work on that bird a little if there's going to be any dinner."<br>"OK."<br>His dad looked out over the water, stood there quietly for a while.<br>"You know, I've been thinking about something."<br>"Yes?"<br>It was coming now. Mom had told Oskar that she let Dad know in no uncertain terms that he had to talk to him about what happened with Jonny. And actually Oskar wanted to talk about it. Dad was at a secure distance from it all, wouldn't interfere in any way. His dad cleared his throat, gathered himself. Breathed out. Looked over the water. Then he said: "Yes, I was thinking… do you have any ice skates?"<br>"No, none that fit me."<br>"No, no. No. Well, if we get ice this winter and it looks like… then it would be fun to have some, wouldn't it. I have some."<br>"They probably won't fit."<br>His dad snorted, a kind of chuckle.<br>"No, but… Osten's boy has some he's grown out of. Thirty-nines. What size do you wear?"<br>"Thirty-eight."<br>"Yes, but with woolen socks you'd… I'll ask him if you can have them."<br>"Great."<br>"Then it's settled. Good. Should we get going, then?"<br>Oskar nodded. Maybe it would come later. And the part about the skates was good. If they could manage it tomorrow then he could bring them back with him.<br>He walked on his mini-skis over to the end of the towrope, backed up until the line was taut, signaled his dad that he was ready. His dad started the moped. They had to go up the hill in first gear. The moped roared so that it frightened some crows out of the top of a pine tree.<br>Oskar glided slowly up the hill like he was going up a rope tow, stood straight with his legs pressed together. He wasn't thinking about anything except trying to keep his skis in the old tracks in order to avoid cutting through the snow layer to the ground. They made their way home as twilight was falling.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Lacke walked down the stairs from the main square with a box of Aladdin chocolates tucked inside the top of his pants. Didn't like to steal, but he had no money and he wanted to give Virginia something. Should have brought roses as well, but try swiping anything at a florist.<br>It was already dark and when he reached the bottom of the hill toward the school he hesitated. Looked around, scraped the snow with his foot, and uncovered a rock the size of a fist that he kicked loose and slipped in<br>his pocket, squeezing his hand around it. Not because he thought it would help against what he had seen but the stone's weight and cold offered a bit of comfort.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>His asking around in the various apartment courtyards had not yielded any results other than guarded, suspicious looks from parents who were out building snowmen with their youngsters. Dirty old man.<br>It was only when he opened his mouth to talk to a woman who was beating rugs that he realized how unnatural his behavior must appear. The woman had paused in her task, turned to him with the stick in her hand like a weapon.<br>"Excuse me," Lacke said,"… yes, I was wondering… I'm looking for a child."<br>"Really?"<br>He heard himself how it sounded, and it made him even more unsure of himself. "Yes, she has… disappeared. I was wondering if someone had seen her around here."<br>"Is it your child?"<br>"No, but…"<br>Apart from a couple of teenagers, he had given up talking to people he didn't know. Or at least recognized. He bumped into some acquaintances, but they hadn't seen anything. Seek and thou shalt find, sure. But then you probably also had to know exactly what you were looking for.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>He came down the path through the park leading to the school and glanced over at Jocke's underpass.<br>The news had made quite a splash in the papers yesterday, mostly because of the macabre way in which the body had been discovered. A murdered alcoholic was normally nothing noteworthy but there had been salacious interest in the children watching, the fire department who had to saw into the ice, etc. Next to the text there was a passport photo of Jocke in which he looked like a mass murderer, at the very least.<br>Lacke continued on past the Blackeberg school's dour brick facade, the wide high steps, like the entrance to the National Courts, or to hell. On the wall next to the lowest step someone had spray painted the words "Iron Maiden," whatever that meant. Maybe some group.<br>He walked past the parking lot, out onto Bjornsonsgatan. Normally he would have taken a short cut across the back of the school but there it was… dark. He could very easily imagine that creature curled up in the shadows. He looked up into the tops of the tall pine trees that bordered the path. A few dark clumps in among the branches. Probably bird nests.<br>It wasn't just what the creature looked like, it was also the way in which it attacked. He would maybe, maybe, have been able to accept the idea that the teeth and claws had some natural explanation, if it hadn't been for the jump from the tree. Before carrying Virginia back he had looked up at the tree. The branch that the creature had jumped from was maybe five meters above the ground.<br>To fall five meters onto someone's back-if you added "circus artist" to the other things to arrive at a "natural explanation," then maybe. But all things considered it was as improbable as what he had said to Virginia, which he now regretted.<br>Damn it…<br>He pulled the box of chocolates from his pants. Maybe his body heat had already melted the chocolates? He shook the box gently. No. It made a rattling sound. The chocolates had not run together. He continued along Bjornsonsgatan, past the ICA store.<br> <br><br>CRUSHED TOMATOES. THREE CANS 5 KRONOR.<br> <br><br>Six days ago.<br>Lacke's hand was still wrapped around the stone. He looked at the sign, could imagine Virginia's concentration in order to make the even, straight letters. Wouldn't she have stayed home to rest today? It would be just like her to stumble in to work before the blood even had a chance to congeal.<br>When he reached the front door of her building he looked up at her window. No light. Maybe she was with her daughter? Well, he had to at least go up and leave the chocolates on her door handle if she wasn't home. It was pitch black inside the stairwell. The hair on the back of his neck stood up.<br>The child is here.<br>He stood frozen in place, then threw himself on the shining red button of the light switch, pushing it in with the back of the hand carrying the box of chocolates. The other hand squeezed tightly around the stone in his pocket.<br>A soft clonking from the relay in the cellar as the light was turned on. Nothing. Virginia's stairwell. Yellow vomit-patterned concrete stairs. Wood doors. He breathed deeply a few times and started up the steps.<br>Only now did he realize how tired he was. Virginia lived all the way up on the third floor, and his legs were dragging him up there, two lifeless planks attached to his hips. He was hoping Virginia was home, that she was feeling good, that he could sink down into her armchair and simply rest in the place he most wanted to be. He let go of the rock in his pocket and rang the bell. Waited a while. Rang it again.<br>He had started trying to balance the box of chocolates on the door handle when he heard creeping steps from within the apartment. He backed away from the door. On the inside, the steps came to a halt. She was standing next to the door, on the other side.<br>"Who is it?"<br>Never, ever had she asked this question before. You rang the bell, you heard her steps, swish swish, and then the door opened. Come in, come in. He cleared his throat. It s me.<br>Pause. Could he hear her breath or was it his imagination?<br>"What do you want?"<br>"I wanted to see how you were doing, that's all."<br>Another pause.<br>"I'm not feeling so good."<br>"Can I come in?"<br>He waited. Held the box of chocolates in front of him in both hands, feeling silly. A bang as she turned the first lock, the rustle of keys as she unlocked the dead bolt. Another rustle as she took the chain off the door. The door handle was pushed down and the door opened.<br>He involuntarily took half a step back, the small of his back hitting against the stair railing. Virginia was standing in the doorway. She looked like she was dying.<br>Besides the swollen cheek, her face was covered with tiny little boils and her eyes looked like she had the hangover of the century: a network of red lines in the whites and the pupils so tightly contracted they had almost disappeared. She nodded. "I look like hell."<br>"No, no. I only… I thought maybe… can I come in?"<br>"No. I don't have the energy."<br>"Have you been to the doctor?"<br>"I will. Tomorrow."<br>"Good. Well, I…"<br>He handed her the box of chocolates that he had been holding in<br>front of him the whole time like a shield. Virginia accepted it. "Thank<br>„ you.<br>"Virginia. Is there anything I can-?"<br>"No. It'll be alright. I just need some rest. Can't stand here any longer. We'll be in touch."<br>"Yes, I'll come by…"<br>Virginia closed the door.<br>"… tomorrow."<br>The rustling of locks and chains again. He stood there outside her door with his arms hanging by his sides. Walked up to the door and put his ear to it. He heard a cabinet opened, slow steps inside the apartment.<br>What should I do?<br>It was not his place to force her to do something she didn't want, but he would have preferred to bring her to the hospital now. Well. He would come back here tomorrow morning. If there was no improvement he would bring her in to the hospital whether she wanted to or not.<br>Lacke walked down the stairs, one step at a time. So tired. When he reached the last flight of stairs before the door to the outside, he sat down on the highest step and leaned his head in his hands.<br>/ am… responsible.<br>The light went off. The tendons in his neck tensed; he drew a ragged breath. Only the relay. On a timer. He sat on the steps in the dark, carefully taking the rock out of his pocket, resting it in both hands and staring out into the dark.<br>Come on, then, he thought. Come on.<br> <br><br>***<br> <br><br>Virginia closed the door on Lacke's pleading face, locked it, and put the chain on. Didn't want him to see her. Didn't want to see anyone. It had cost her a great effort to say those few words, to act according to some basic form of normality.<br>Her condition had deteriorated rapidly after she got home from the ICA store. Lotten had helped her home and in her dazed state she had simply put up with the pain of daylight on her face. Once she was home she had looked in the mirror and seen the hundreds of tiny blisters on her face and hands. Burn marks.<br>She had slept for a few hours, woken up when it got dark. Her hunger had then changed in nature, been transformed into anxiety. A school of hysterically wriggling little fish now filled her circulatory system. She could neither lie down, nor sit, nor stand. She walked around and around the apartment, scratched her body, took a cold shower to dampen the jumpy, tingling feeling. Nothing helped.<br>It defied description. It reminded her of when she was twenty-two and had been informed that her father had fallen from the roof of their summer cottage and broken his neck. That time she had also walked around and around as if there was not a single place on earth where her body could rest, where it didn't hurt.<br>Same thing now, except worse. The anxiety did not let up for a moment. It forced her around the apartment until she couldn't stand it any longer, until she sat down on a chair and banged her head into the kitchen table. In desperation she took two sleeping pills and washed them down with a couple of mouthfuls of wine that tasted like dishwater.<br>Normally one was all she needed to fall asleep as if she had been hit in the head. The only effect on her now was that she became intensely nauseated and after five minutes vomited green slime and both of the half-dissolved tablets.<br>She kept walking around, ripped a newspaper into tiny pieces, crawled on the floor and whimpered. She crawled into the kitchen, pushed the bottle of wine from the table so it fell to the ground and broke in front of her eyes.<br>She picked up one of the broken shards.<br>Didn't think. Just pressed it into the palm of her hand and the pain felt good, felt right. The school of fish in her body rushed toward the point of the pain and blood welled out. She pressed the palm to her mouth and licked it, and the anxiety gave way. She cried with relief while she punctured her hand in a new place and kept sucking. The taste of blood mingled with the taste of tears.<br>Curled up on the kitchen floor, with her hand pressed against her mouth, greedily sucking like a newborn child that finds its mother's breast for the first time, she felt-for the second time on this terrible day-calm.<br>About half an hour after she had stood up from the floor, swept the shards up from the floor, and put on a Band-Aid, the anxiety had started to return. That was when Lacke had rung the bell.<br>When she had sent him away and locked the door she walked out into the kitchen and put the box of chocolates in the pantry. She sat down on a kitchen chair and tried to understand. The anxiety would not let her. Soon it would force her to her feet again. The only thing she knew was that no one could be with her here. Particularly not Lacke. She would hurt him. The anxiety would drive her to it.<br>She had contracted some kind of disease. There were medicines for diseases.<br>Tomorrow she would consult a doctor, someone who could examine her and say that: Well, this was simply an attack of X. We'll have to put you on Y and Z for a couple of weeks. That'll clear it right up.<br>She walked to and fro in the apartment. It was starting to get unbearable again.<br>She hit her arms, her legs, but the small fish had come back to life and nothing helped. She knew what she had to do. She sobbed from fear of the pain but the actual sensation was so brief and the relief so great.<br>She walked out into the kitchen and got a sharp little fruit knife, went back out and sat down in the couch in the living room, rested the blade against the underside of her arm.<br>Only to get her through the night. Tomorrow she would seek help. It<br>was self-evident she couldn't keep going like this. Drink her own blood. Of course not. There would have to be a change. But for now…<br>The saliva rose up in her mouth, wet anticipation. She cut into herself. Deeply…</p>

      <a href="book/novel/story_of_king_Arthur_and_his_Knights_vmojrj.pdf.html"><h2>KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS. </h2></a>
      <h3> PREVIEW:</h3>
      <p>Sir Kay takes hand in the lists.<br>Now the party with which Sir Kay had cast his lot was at the north of the field, and that company was fourscore and thirteen in number; and the other party stood at the south end of the field, and that company was fourscore and sixteen in number. But though the party with whom Sir Kay had attached himself numbered less by three than the other party, yet was it the stronger by some degree because that there were a number of knights of great strength and renown in that company. Indeed it may be here mentioned that two of those knights afterward became companions in very good credit of the round table—to wit: Sir Mador de la Porte, and Sir Bedevere—which latter was the last who saw King Arthur alive upon this earth.<br><br>So, when all was prepared according to the ordination of the tournament, and when those knights-contestant had made themselves ready in all ways that were necessary, and when they had dressed their spears and their shields in such a manner as befitted knights about to enter serious battle, the herald set his trumpet to his lips a second time and blew upon it with might and main. Then, having sounded this blast, he waited for a while and then he blew upon the trumpet again.<br><br>And, upon that blast, each of those parties of knights quitted its station and rushed forth in great tumult against the other party, and that with such noise and fury that the whole earth groaned beneath the feet of the war-horses, and trembled and shook as with an earthquake.<br><br>So those two companies met, the one against the other, in the midst of the field, and the roar of breaking lances was so terrible that those who heard it were astonished and appalled at the sound. For several fair dames swooned away with terror of the noise, and others shrieked aloud; for not only was there that great uproar, but the air was altogether filled with the splinters of ash wood that flew about.<br><br>In that famous assault threescore and ten very noble and honorable knights were overthrown, many of them being trampled beneath the hoofs of the horses; wherefore, when the two companies withdrew in retreat each to his station the ground was beheld to be covered all over with broken fragments of lances and with cantels of armor, and many knights were seen to be wofully lying in the midst of all that wreck. And some of these champions strove to arise and could not, while others lay altogether quiet as though in death. To these ran divers esquires and pages in great numbers, and lifted up the fallen men and bare them away to places of safe harborage. And likewise attendants ran and gathered up the cantels of armor and the broken spears, and bare them away to the barriers, so that, by and by, the field was altogether cleared once more.<br><br>Then all those who gazed down upon that meadow gave loud acclaim with great joyousness of heart, for such a noble and glorious contest at arms in friendly assay had hardly ever been beheld in all that realm before.<br><br>Sir Kay bears himself well in the encounter.<br>Now turn we unto Sir Kay; for in this assault he had conducted himself with such credit that no knight who was there had done better than he, and maybe no one had done so well as he. For, though two opponents at once had directed their spears against him, yet he had successfully resisted their assault. And one of those two he smote so violently in the midst of his defences that he had lifted that assailant entirely over the crupper of the horse which he rode, and had flung him down to the distance of half a spear’s length behind his steed, so that the fallen knight had rolled thrice over in the dust ere he ceased to fall.<br><br>And when those of Sir Kay’s party who were nigh to him beheld what he did, they gave him loud and vehement acclaim, and that in such measure that Sir Kay was wonderfully well satisfied and pleased at heart.<br><br>And, indeed, it is to be said that at that time there was hardly any knight in all the world who was so excellent in deeds of arms as Sir Kay. And though there afterward came knights of much greater renown and of more glorious achievement (as shall be hereinafter recorded in good season), yet at that time Sir Kay was reckoned by many to be one of the most wonderfully puissant knights (whether errant or in battle) in all of that realm.<br><br>So was that course of the combat run to the great pleasure and satisfaction of all who beheld it, and more especially of Sir Kay and his friends. And after it had been completed the two parties in array returned each to its assigned station once more.<br><br>And when they had come there, each knight delivered up his spear unto his esquire. For the assault which was next to be made was to be undertaken with swords, wherefore all lances and other weapons were to be put away; such being the order of that courteous and gentle bout at arms.<br><br>Of the contest with swords.<br>Accordingly, when the herald again blew upon his trumpet, each knight drew his weapon with such readiness for battle that there was a great splendor of blades all flashing in the air at once. And when the herald blew a second time each party pushed forward to the contest with great nobleness of heart and eagerness of spirit, every knight being moved with intent to engage his oppugnant with all the might and main that lay in him.<br><br>Then immediately began so fierce a battle that if those knights had been very enemies of long standing instead of friendly contestants, the blows which they delivered the one upon the other could not have been more vehement as to strength or more astonishing to gaze upon.<br><br>And in this affair likewise Sir Kay approved himself to be so extraordinary a champion that his like was nowhere to be seen in all that field; for he violently smote down five knights, the one after the other, ere he was stayed in his advance.<br><br>Wherefore, beholding him to be doing work of such a sort, several of the knights of the other party endeavored to come at him with intent to meet him in his advance.<br><br>Amongst these was a certain knight, hight Sir Balamorgineas, who was so huge of frame that he rode head and shoulders above any other knight. And he was possessed of such extraordinary strength that it was believed that he could successfully withstand the assault of three ordinary knights at one time. Wherefore when this knight beheld the work that Sir Kay did, he cried out to him, “Ho! ho! Sir Knight of the black gryphon, turn thou hitherward and do a battle with me!”<br><br>Sir Kay contests with Sir Balamorgineas.<br>Now when Sir Kay beheld Sir Balamorgineas to be minded to come against him in that wise—very threateningly and minded to do him battle—he turned him toward his enemy with great cheerfulness of spirit. For at that time Sir Kay was very full of youthful fire and reckoned nothing of assaulting any enemy who might demand battle of him.<br><br>(So it was at that time. But it after befell, when he became Seneschal, and when other and mightier knights appeared at the court of the King, that he would sometimes avoid an encounter with such a knight as Sir Launcelot, or Sir Pellias, or Sir Marhaus, or Sir Gawaine, if he might do so with credit to his honor.)<br><br>So, being very full of the spirit of youth, he turned him with great lustiness of heart, altogether inflamed with the eagerness and fury of battle. And he cried out in a great voice, “Very well, I will do battle with thee, and I will cast thee down like thy fellows!” And therewith he smote with wonderful fierceness at Sir Balamorgineas, and that with all his might. And Sir Balamorgineas received the stroke upon his helmet and was altogether bewildered by the fury thereof, for he had never felt its like before that time. Wherefore his brains swam so light that it was necessary for him to hold to the horn of his saddle to save himself from falling.<br><br>Sir Kay breaketh his sword.<br>But it was a great pity for Sir Kay that, with the fierceness of the blow, his sword-blade snapped short at the haft, flying so high in the air that it appeared to overtop the turrets of the cathedral in its flight. Yet so it happened, and thus it befell that Sir Kay was left without any weapon. Yet it was thought that, because of that stroke, he had Sir Balamorgineas entirely at his mercy, and that if he could have struck another blow with his sword he might easily have overcome him.<br><br>But as it was, Sir Balamorgineas presently so far recovered himself that he perceived his enemy to be altogether at his mercy; wherefore, being filled beyond measure with rage because of the blow he had received, he pushed against Sir Kay with intent to smite him down in a violent assault.<br><br>In this pass it would maybe have gone very ill with Sir Kay but that three of his companions in arms, perceiving the extreme peril in which he lay, thrust in betwixt him and Sir Balamorgineas with intent to take upon themselves the assault of that knight and so to save Sir Kay from overthrow. This they did with such success that Sir Kay was able to push out from the press and to escape to the barriers without suffering any further harm at the hands of his enemies.<br><br>Sir Kay bids Arthur get him a sword.<br>Now when he reached the barrier, his esquire, young Arthur, came running to him with a goblet of spiced wine. And Sir Kay opened the umbril of his helmet for to drink, for he was athirst beyond measure. And, lo! his face was all covered over with blood and sweat, and he was so a-drought with battle that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth and he could not speak. But when he had drunk of the draught that Arthur gave him, his tongue was loosened and he cried out to the young man in a loud and violent voice: “Ho! ho! Brother, get me another sword for to do battle, for I am assuredly winning for our house much glory this day!” And Arthur said, “Where shall I get thee a sword?” And Kay said, “Make haste unto our father’s pavilion and fetch me thence another sword, for this which I have is broken.” And Arthur said, “I will do so with all speed,” and thereupon he set hand to the barrier and leaped over it into the alleyway beyond. And he ran down the alleyway with all the speed that he was able with intent to fulfil that task which his brother had bidden him to undertake; and with like speed he ran to that pavilion that his father had set up in the meadows.<br><br>But when he came to the pavilion of Sir Ector he found no one there, for all the attendants had betaken themselves unto the tournament. And neither could he find any sword fit for his brother’s handling, wherefore he was put to a great pass to know what to do in that matter.<br><br>Arthur draweth the sword from the anvil.<br>In this extremity he bethought him of that sword that stood thrust into the anvil before the cathedral, and it appeared to him that such a sword as that would suit his brother’s purposes very well. Wherefore he said to himself, “I will go thither and get that sword if I am able to do so, for it will assuredly do very well for my brother for to finish his battle withal.” Whereupon he ran with all speed to the cathedral. And when he had come there he discovered that no one was there upon guard at the block of marble, as had heretofore been the case, for all who had been upon guard had betaken themselves unto the contest of arms that was toward. And the anvil and the sword stood where he could reach them. So, there being no one to stay young Arthur, he leaped up upon the block of marble and laid his hands unto the hilt of the sword. And he bent his body and drew upon the sword very strongly, and, lo! it came forth from the anvil with wonderful smoothness and ease, and he held the sword in his hand, and it was his.<br><br>And when he had got the sword in that way, he wrapped it in his cloak so that no one might see it (for it shone with an exceeding brightness and splendor) and he leaped down from the block of marble stone and hastened with it unto the field of battle.<br><br>Now when Arthur had entered into that meadow once more, he found Sir Kay awaiting his coming with great impatience of spirit. And when Sir Kay saw him he cried out, very vehemently, “Hast thou got a sword?” And Arthur said, “Yea, I have one here.” Thereupon he opened his cloak and showed Sir Kay what sword it was he had brought.<br><br>Now when Sir Kay beheld the sword he immediately knew it, and he wist not what to think or what to say, wherefore he stood for a while, like one turned into a stone, looking upon that sword. Then in awhile he said, in a very strange voice “Where got ye that sword?” And Arthur looked upon his brother and he beheld that his countenance was greatly disturbed, and that his face was altogether as white as wax. And he said, “Brother, what ails thee that thou lookest so strangely. I will tell the entire truth. I could find no sword in our father’s pavilion, wherefore I bethought me of that sword that stood in the anvil upon the marble cube before the cathedral. So I went thither and made assay for to draw it forth, and it came forth with wonderful ease. So, when I had drawn it out, I wrapped it in my cloak and brought it hither unto thee as thou beholdest.”<br><br>Sir Kay keepeth the sword for his own.<br>Then Sir Kay turned his thoughts inward and communed with himself in this wise, “Lo! my brother Arthur is as yet hardly more than a child. And he is, moreover, exceedingly innocent. Therefore he knoweth not what he hath done in this nor what the doing thereof signifieth. Now, since he hath achieved this weapon, why should I not myself lay claim to that achievement, and so obtain the glory which it signifieth.” Whereupon he presently aroused himself, and he said to Arthur, “Give the sword and the cloak to me,” and Arthur did as his brother commanded. And when he had done so Sir Kay said to him, “Tell no man of this but keep it privy in thine own heart. Meantime go thou to our father where he sits at the lists and bid come straightway unto the pavilion where we have taken up our inn.”<br><br>And Arthur did as Sir Kay commanded him, greatly possessed with wonder that his brother should be so disturbed in spirit as he had appeared to be. For he wist not what he had done in drawing out that sword from the anvil, nor did he know of what great things should arise from that little thing, for so it is in this world that a man sometimes approves himself to be worthy of such a great trust as that, and yet, in lowliness of spirit, he is yet altogether unaware that he is worthy thereof. And so it was with young Arthur at that time.<br><br>[Image unavailable.]<br> <br><br>[Image unavailable.]<br>Chapter Second.<br>How Arthur Twice Performed the Miracle of the Sword Before Sir Ector and of How His Birthright Was Discovered Unto Him.<br><br>SO Arthur made haste to that part of the lists where Sir Ector sat with the people of his household. And he stood before his father and said, “Sire, my brother Kay hath sent me hitherward for to bid thee come straightway unto the pavilion where we have taken up our inn. And, truly, I think something very extraordinary hath befallen, for my brother Kay hath such a countenance as I never saw him wear.”<br><br>Then Sir Ector marvelled very greatly what it was that should cause Sir Kay to quit that battle and to summon him at such a time, wherefore he arose from where he sat and went with Arthur. And they went to the pavilion, and when he had come there, behold! Sir Kay was standing in the midst of the pavilion. And Sir Ector saw that his face was as white as ashes of wood and that his eyes shone with a wonderful brightness. And Sir Ector said, “My son, what ails thee?” whereunto Sir Kay made reply, “Sire, here is a very wonderful matter.” Therewith he took his father by the hand and brought him to the table that stood in the pavilion. And upon the table there lay a cloak and there was something within the cloak. Then Sir Kay opened the cloak and, lo! there lay the sword of the anvil, and the hilt thereof and the blade thereof glistered with exceeding splendor.<br><br>Sir Ector beholdeth the sword.<br>And Sir Ector immediately knew that sword and whence it came. Wherefore he was filled with such astonishment that he wist not what to do. And for a while his tongue refused to speak, and after a while he found speech and cried out aloud in a great voice, “What is this that mine eyes behold!”<br><br>To this Sir Kay made reply, “Sire. I have that sword which stood a while since embedded in the anvil that stands upon the cube of marble stone before the great cathedral. Wherefore I demand that thou tellest me what this may foretend?”<br><br>Then Sir Ector said, “How came you by that sword?”<br><br>And for a while Sir Kay was silent, but after a while he said, “Sire, I brake my sword in that battle which of late I fought, whereupon I found me this sword in its stead.”<br><br>Then Sir Ector was altogether bemazed and knew not whether to believe what his ears heard. And after awhile he said, “If so be that thou didst draw forth this sword from the anvil, then it must also be that thou art rightwise King of Britain, for so the saying of the sword proclaimeth. But if thou didst indeed draw it forth from the anvil, then it will be that thou shalt as easily be able for to thrust it back again into that place from whence thou didst take it.”<br><br>At this a great trouble of spirit fell upon Sir Kay, and he cried out in a very loud voice, “Who may do such a thing as that, and who could perform so great a miracle as to thrust a sword into solid iron.” Whereunto Sir Ector made reply, “Such a miracle is no greater than the miracle that thou hast performed in drawing it out from its embedment. For who ever heard that a man could draw forth a sword from a place and yet would not thrust it back whence he drew it?”<br><br>Then Sir Kay wist not what to say to his father, and he greatly feared that he should not be able to perform that miracle. But, nevertheless, he took what comfort to himself he was able, saying, “If my young brother Arthur was able to perform this miracle why should I not do a miracle of a like sort, for, assuredly, I am not less worthy than he. Wherefore if he drew the sword forth with such ease, it may be that I with equal ease shall be able to thrust it back into its place again.” Accordingly he took such comfort to himself in these thoughts as he was able.<br><br>Sir Kay assays to put back the sword but faileth.<br>So he wrapped the sword in the cloak again, and when he had done so he and Sir Ector went forth from the pavilion and betook their way unto where was the marble stone and the anvil before the cathedral. And Arthur went with his father and his brother and they forebade him not. And when they had come to that place where the sword had been, Sir Kay mounted upon the cube of marble stone and beheld the face of the anvil. And lo! the face of the anvil was altogether smooth and without a scratch or scar of any sort. And Sir Kay said to himself, “What is this my father would have me do! What man is there in life who could thrust a sword-blade into a solid anvil of iron?” But, ne’theless, he could not withdraw from that impossible undertaking, but was constrained to assay that miracle, wherefore he set the point of the sword to the iron and bore upon it with all his strength. But it was impossible for him to accomplish that thing, and though he endeavored with all his might with the sword against the face of the anvil, yet did he not pierce the iron even to the breadth of a hair.<br><br>So, after he had thus assayed for a great while, he at last ceased what he did and came down from where he stood. And he said to his father, “Sire, no man in life may perform that miracle.”<br><br>Unto this Sir Ector made reply, “How is it possible then that thou couldst have drawn out that sword as thou sayst and yet cannot put it back again?”<br><br>Then young Arthur lifted up his voice and said, “My father, have I thy leave to speak?” And Sir Ector said, “Speak, my son.” And Arthur said, “I would that I might assay to handle that sword?” Whereunto Sir Ector replied, “By what authority wouldst thou handle that sword?” And Arthur said, “Because it was I who drew that sword forth from the anvil for my brother. Wherefore, as thou sayest, to draw it forth is not more difficult than to thrust it back again. So I believe that I shall be able to set it back into the iron whence I drew it.”<br><br>Then Sir Ector gazed upon young Arthur in such a strange manner that Arthur wist not why he looked at him in that wise. Wherefore he cried out, “Sire, why dost thou gaze so strangely upon me? Has thou anger against me?” Whereunto Sir Ector made reply, “In the sight of God, my son, I have no anger against thee.” Then he said, “If thou hast a desire to handle the sword, thou mayst assuredly make assay of that miracle.”<br><br>Arthur performeth the miracle of the sword and the anvil.<br>So Arthur took the sword from his brother Kay and he leaped up upon the marble stone. And he set the point of the sword upon the anvil and bare very strongly upon it and lo! the sword penetrated very smoothly into the centre of the anvil until it stood midway deep therein, and there it stood fast. And after he had performed that miracle he drew the sword forth again very swiftly and easily, and then thrust it back again once more as he had done before.<br><br>But when Sir Ector beheld what Arthur did, he cried out in a voice of exceeding loudness, “Lord! Lord! what is the miracle mine eyes behold!” And when Arthur came down from the cube of marble stone, Sir Ector kneeled down before him and set his hands together, palm to palm.<br><br>But when Arthur beheld what his father did, he cried out aloud like one in a great measure of pain; and he said, “My father! my father! why dost thou kneel down to me?”<br><br>To him Sir Ector made reply, “I am not thy father, and now it is made manifest that thou art assuredly of very exalted race and that the blood of kings flows in thy veins, else thou couldst not have handled that sword as thou hast done.”<br><br>Then Arthur fell a-weeping beyond all measure and he cried out as with great agony of spirit, “Father! father! what is this thou sayst? I beseech thee to arise and not to kneel unto me.”<br><br>So Sir Ector arose from his knees and stood before the face of Arthur, and he said, “Arthur, why dost thou weep?” And Arthur said, “Because I am afeard.”<br><br>Now all this while Sir Kay had stood near by and he could neither move nor speak, but stood like one entranced, and he said to himself, “What is this? Is my brother a King?”<br><br>Then Sir Ector spake, saying, “Arthur, the time hath come for thee to know thyself, for the true circumstances of thy life have, heretofore, been altogether hidden from thee.<br><br>Sir Ector telleth Arthur the circumstances of his infancy.<br>“Now I do confess everything to thee in this wise: that eighteen year ago there came to me a certain man very wise and high in favor with Uther-Pendragon and that man was the Enchanter Merlin. And Merlin showed me the signet ring of Uther-Pendragon and he commanded me by virtue of that ring that I should be at a certain assigned place at a particular time which he nominated; and the place which he assigned was the postern gate of Uther-Pendragon’s castle; and the time which he named was midnight of that very day.<br><br>“And he bade me tell no man aught concerning those things which he communicated to me, and so I kept his counsel as he desired me to do.<br><br>“So I went to that postern gate at midnight as Merlin had commanded, and at that place there came unto me Merlin and another man, and the other man was Sir Ulfius, who was the chief knight of Uther-Pendragon’s household. And I tell thee that these two worthies stood nigher unto Uther-Pendragon than any other men in all of the world.<br><br>“Now when those two came unto me, I perceived that Merlin bare in his arms a certain thing wrapped in a scarlet mantle of fine texture. And he opened the folds of the mantle and, lo! I beheld a child not long born and wrapped in swaddling clothes. And I saw the child in the light of a lanthorn which Sir Ulfius bare, and I perceived that he was very fair of face and large of bone—and thou wert that child.<br><br>“Then Merlin commanded me in this wise: that I was to take that child and that I should rear him as mine own; and he said that the child was to be called by the name of Arthur; and he said that no one in all the world was to know otherwise than that the child was mine own. And I told Merlin that I would do as he would have me, whereupon I took the child and bare it away with me. And I proclaimed that the child was mine own, and all over the world believed my words, wherefore no one ever knew otherwise than that thou wert mine own son. And that lady who was my wife, when she died she took that secret with her unto Paradise, and since then until now no one in all the world knew aught of this matter but I and those two aforementioned worthies.<br><br>“Nor have I until now ever known aught of who was thy father; but now I do suspect who he was and that thou hast in thy veins very high and kingly blood. And I do have in mind that perhaps thy father was Uther-Pendragon himself. For who but the son of Uther-Pendragon could have drawn forth that sword from out of the anvil as thou hast done?”<br><br>Then, when Arthur heard that saying of his father’s, he cried out in a very loud and vehement voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe!”—saying that word three times. And Sir Ector said, “Arthur, why art thou woful?” And Arthur said, “Because I have lost my father, for I would rather have my father than be a King!”<br><br>Merlin and Sir Ulfius appear to the three.<br><br>Now as these things passed, there came unto that place two men, very tall and of a wonderfully noble and haughty appearance. And when these two men had come nigh to where they were, Arthur and Sir Ector and Sir Kay preceived that one of them was the Enchanter Merlin and that the other was Sir Ulfius—for those two men were very famous and well known unto all the world. And when those two had come to where were the three, Merlin spake, saying, “What cheer?” And Sir Ector made answer, “Here is cheer of a very wonderful sort; for, behold, Merlin! this is that child that thou didst bring unto me eighteen years ago, and, lo! thou seest he hath grown unto manhood.”<br><br>Then Merlin said, “Sir Ector, I know very well who is this youth, for I have kept diligent watch over him for all this time. And I know that in him lieth the hope of Britain. Moreover, I tell thee that even to-day within the surface of an enchanted looking-glass I have beheld all that he hath done since the morning; and I know how he drew forth the sword from the anvil, and how he thrust it back again; and I know how he drew it forth and thrust it back a second time. And I know all that thou hast been saying unto him this while; wherefore I also do now avouch that thou hast told him the very truth. And, lo! the spirit of prophecy is upon me and I do foresee into the future that thou, Arthur, shall become the greatest and most famous King that ever lived in Britain; and I do foresee that many knights of extraordinary excellence shall gather about thee and that men shall tell of their marvellous deeds as long as this land shall continue, and I do foresee that through these knights thy reign shall be full of splendor and glory; and I do foresee that the most marvellous adventure of the Holy Grail shall be achieved by three of the knights of thy Court, and that to thy lasting renown, who shall be the King under whose reign the holy cup shall be achieved. All these things I foresee; and, lo! the time is now at hand when the glory of thy House shall again be made manifest unto the world, and all the people of this land shall rejoice in thee and thy kinghood. Wherefore, Sir Ector, for these three days to come, I do charge it upon thee that thou do guard this young man as the apple of thine eye, for in him doth lie the hope and salvation of all this realm.”<br><br>Sir Ector craveth a boon of Arthur.<br>Then Sir Ector lifted up his voice and cried unto Arthur, “A boon! a boon!” And Arthur said, “Alas! how is this? Dost thou, my father, ask a boon of me who may have all in the world that is mine to give? Ask what thou wilt and it is thine!” Then Sir Ector said, “I do beseech this of thee: that when thou art King thy brother Kay may be Seneschal of all this realm.” And Arthur said, “It shall be as thou dost ask.” And he said, “As for thee, it shall be still better with thee, for thou shalt be my father unto the end!” Whereupon so saying, he took Sir Ector’s head into his hands and he kissed Sir Ector upon the forehead and upon the cheeks, and so sealed his plighted word.<br><br>But all this while Sir Kay had stood like unto one struck by thunder, and he wist not whether to be uplifted unto the skies or to be cast down into the depths, that his young brother should thus have been passed by him and exalted unto that extraordinary altitude of fortune. Wherefore he stood like to one bereft of life and motion.<br><br>And let it here be said that Arthur fulfilled all that he had thus promised to his father—for, in after times, he made Sir Kay his Seneschal, and Sir Ector was to him a father until the day of his death, which same befell five years from that time.<br><br> <br><br>Thus I have told you how the royalty of Arthur was first discovered. And now, if you will listen, ye shall hear how it was confirmed before all the world.<br><br>[Image unavailable.]<br> <br><br>[Image unavailable.]<br>Chapter Third.<br>How Several Kings and High Dukes Assayed to Draw the Sword Out of the Anvil and How They Failed. Likewise How Arthur Made the Assay and Succeeded Therein.<br><br>SO when the morning of Christmas day had come, many thousands of folk of all qualities, both gentle and simple, gathered together in front of the cathedral for to behold the assay of that sword.<br><br>Now there had been a canopy of embroidered cloth of divers colors spread above the sword and the anvil, and a platform had been built around about the cube of marble stone. And nigh unto that place there had been a throne for the Archbishop established; for the Archbishop was to overlook that assay and to see that every circumstance was fulfilled with due equity and circumspection.<br><br>So, when the morning was half gone by, the Archbishop himself came with great pomp of estate and took his seat upon the high throne that had been placed for him, and all his court of clerks and knights gathered about him, so that he presented a very proud and excellent appearance of courtliness.<br><br>Now unto that assay there had gathered nineteen kings and sixteen dukes, and each of these was of such noble and exalted estate that he entertained high hopes that he would that day be approved before the world to be the right king and overlord of all Britain. Wherefore after the Archbishop had established himself upon his throne, there came several of these and made demand that he should straightway put that matter to the test. So the Archbishop commanded his herald for to sound a trumpet, and to bid all who had the right to make assay of the sword to come unto that adventure, and the herald did according as the Archbishop ordered.<br><br>King Lot of Orkney maketh assay of the sword and faileth.<br>And when the herald had sounded his trumpet there immediately appeared the first of those kings to make trial of the sword, and he who came was King Lot of Orkney and the Isles. With King Lot there came eleven knights and five esquires, so that he appeared in very noble estate before the eyes of all. And when King Lot had arrived at that place, he mounted the platform. And first he saluted the Archbishop, and then he laid his hands to the pommel of the sword in the sight of all. And he bent his body and drew upon the sword with great strength, but he could not move the blade in the anvil even so much as the breadth of a hair, for it stood as fast as the iron in which it was planted. And after that first assay he tried three times more, but still he was altogether unable to move the blade in the iron. Then, after that he had thus four times made assay, he ceased his endeavor and came down from that place. And he was filled with great anger and indignation that he had not succeeded in his endeavor.<br><br>Sundry others make assay and fail.<br>And after King Lot there came his brother-in-law, King Urien of Gore, and he also made assay in the same wise as King Lot had done. But neither did he succeed any better than that other king. And after King Urien there came King Fion of Scotland, and after King Fion there came King Mark of Cornwall, and after King Mark there came King Ryence of North Wales, and after King Ryence there came King Leodegrance of Cameliard, and after him came all those other kings and dukes before numerated, and not one of all these was able to move the blade. And some of these high and mighty lords were filled with anger and indignation that they had not succeeded, and others were ashamed that they had failed in that undertaking before the eyes of all those who looked upon them. But whether they were angry or whether they were ashamed it in no wise helped their case.<br><br>Now when all the kings and dukes had thus failed in that adventure, the people who were there were very much astonished, and they said to one another, “How is this? If all those kings and dukes of very exalted estate have failed to achieve that adventure, who then may hope to succeed? For here have been all those who were most worthy of that high honor, and all have tried to draw that sword and all have failed. Who then is there now to come after these who may hope to succeed?”<br><br>The kings and dukes are discontented.<br>And, likewise, those kings and dukes spoke together in the same manner. And by and by there came six of the most worthy—to wit, King Lot, King Urien, King Pellinore, King Ban, King Ryence, and Duke Clarence of Northumberland—and these stood before the throne of the Archbishop and spake to him in this wise: “Sir, here have all the kings and dukes of this realm striven before you for to draw forth that sword, and lo! not one of all those who have undertaken that thing hath succeeded in his undertaking. What, then, may we understand but that the enchanter Merlin hath set this adventure for to bring shame and discredit upon all of us who are here, and upon you, who are the head of the church in this realm? For who in all the world may hope to draw forth a sword-blade out from a bed of solid iron? Behold! it is beyond the power of any man. Is it not then plain to be seen that Merlin hath made a mock of us all? Now, therefore, lest all this great congregation should have been called here in vain, we do beseech you of your wisdom that you presently choose the one from among the kings here gathered, who may be best fitted to be overlord of this realm. And when ye shall have chosen him, we will promise to obey him in all things whatsoever he may ordain. Verily, such a choice as that will be better worth while than to spend time in this foolish task of striving to draw forth a sword out of an anvil which no man in all the world may draw forth.”<br><br>Then was the Archbishop much troubled in spirit, for he said to himself, “Can it be sooth that Merlin hath deceived me, and hath made a mock of me and of all these kings and lordly folk? Surely this cannot be. For Merlin is passing wise, and he would not make a mock of all the realm for the sake of so sorry a jest as this would be. Certes he hath some intent in this of which we know naught, being of less wisdom than he—wherefore I will be patient for a while longer.” Accordingly, having communed thus within himself, he spake aloud in this wise to those seven high lords: “Messires,” he said, “I have yet faith that Merlin hath not deceived us, wherefore I pray your patience for one little while longer. For if, in the time a man may count five hundred twice over, no one cometh forward to perform this task, then will I, at your behest, proceed to choose one from amongst you and will proclaim him King and Overlord of all.” For the Archbishop had faith that Merlin was about to immediately declare a king before them all.<br><br> <br><br>Now leave we these and turn we unto Arthur and his father and brother.<br><br>For Merlin had bidden those three to abide in their pavilion until such time as he thought would be fit for them to come out thence. And that time being now come, Merlin and Sir Ulfius went to the pavilion of Sir Ector, and Merlin said, “Arthur, arise and come forth, for now the hour is come for thee to assay before the whole world that miracle which thou didst of late execute in privacy.” So Arthur did as Merlin bade him to do, and he came forth from the pavilion with his father and his brother, and, lo! he was like one who walked in a dream.<br><br>Merlin bringeth Arthur to the assay.<br>So they five went down from thence toward the cathedral and unto that place of assay. And when they had come to the congregation there assembled, the people made way for them, greatly marvelling and saying to one another, “Who are these with the Enchanter Merlin and Sir Ulfius, and whence come they? For all the world knew Merlin and Sir Ulfius, and they wist that here was something very extraordinary about to happen. And Arthur was clad all in flame-colored raiment embroidered with threads of silver, so that others of the people said, “Certes, that youth is very fair for to look upon; now who may he be?”<br><br>But Merlin said no word to any man, but he brought Arthur through the press unto that place where the Archbishop sat; and the press made way for him so that he was not stayed in his going. And when the Archbishop beheld Merlin come thus with those others, he arose and said, “Merlin, who are these whom thou bringest unto us, and what is their business here?” And Merlin said, “Lord, here is one come to make the assay of yonder sword.” And the Archbishop said, “Which one is he?” and Merlin said, “This is he,” and he laid his hand upon Arthur.<br><br>Merlin proclaimeth the royalty of Arthur.<br>Then the Archbishop looked upon Arthur and he beheld that the youth was very comely of face, wherefore his heart went out unto Arthur and he loved him a very great deal. And the Archbishop said, “Merlin, by what right doth this young man come hither?” And Merlin made reply, “Lord, he cometh hither by the best right that there is in the world; for he who standeth before thee clad in red is the true son of Uther-Pendragon and of his lawful wife, Queen Igraine.”<br><br>Then the Archbishop cried out aloud in great amazement and those who stood nigh and who heard what Merlin said were so astonished that they wist not what to think. And the Archbishop said, “Merlin, what is this that thou tellest me? For who, until now, in all the world hath ever heard that Uther-Pendragon had a son?”<br><br>Unto this Merlin made reply: “No one hath ever known of such a thing until now, only a very few. For it was in this wise: When this child was born the spirit of prophecy lay upon me and I foresaw that Uther-Pendragon would die before a very great while. Wherefore I feared that the enemies of the King would lay violent hands upon the young child for the sake of his inheritance. So, at the King’s behest, I and another took the young child from his mother and gave him unto a third, and that man received the kingly child and maintained him ever since as his own son. And as to the truth of these things there are others here who may attest the verity of them—for he who was with me when the young child was taken from his mother was Sir Ulfius, and he to whom he was entrusted was Sir Ector of Bonmaison—and those two witnesses, who are without any reproach, will avouch to the verity of that which I have asserted, for here they stand before thee to certify unto what I have said.”<br><br>And Sir Ulfius and Sir Ector said, “All that Merlin hath spoken is true, and thereunto we do pledge our most faithful and sacred word of honor.”<br><br>Then the Archbishop said, “Who is there may doubt the word of such honorable witnesses?” And he looked upon Arthur and smiled upon him.<br><br>Then Arthur said, “Have I then thy leave, Lord, to handle yonder sword?” And the Archbishop said, “Thou hast my leave, and may the grace of God go with thee to do thy endeavor.”<br><br>Arthur draweth forth the sword.<br>Thereupon Arthur went to the cube of marble stone and he laid his hands upon the haft of the sword that was thrust into the anvil. And he bent his body and drew very strongly and, lo! the sword came forth with great ease and very smoothly. And when he had got the sword into his hands, he swung it about his head so that it flashed like lightning. And after he had swung it thus thrice about his head, he set the point thereof against the face of the anvil and bore upon it very strongly, and, behold! the sword slid very smoothly back again into that place where it had aforetime stood; and when it was there, midway deep, it stood fast where it was. And thus did Arthur successfully accomplish that marvellous miracle of the sword in the eyes of all the world.<br><br>Now when the people who were congregated at that place beheld this miracle performed before their faces, they lifted up their voices all together, and shouted so vehemently and with so huge a tumult of outcry that it was as though the whole earth rocked and trembled with the sound of their shouting.<br><br>And whiles they so shouted Arthur took hold of the sword again and drew it forth and swung it again, and again drave it back into the anvil. And when he had done that he drew it forth a third time and did the same thing as before. Thus it was that all those who were there beheld that miracle performed three times over.<br><br>Several of the kings and dukes are angry.<br>And all the kings and dukes who were there were filled with great amazement, and they wist not what to think or to say when they beheld one who was little more than a boy perform that undertaking in which the best of them had failed. And some of them, seeing that miracle, were willing to acknowledge Arthur because of it, but others would not acknowledge him. These withdrew themselves and stood aloof; and as they stood thus apart, they said among themselves: “What is this and who can accredit such a thing that a beardless boy should be set before us all and should be made King and overlord of this great realm for to govern us. Nay! nay! we will have none of him for our King.” And others said, “Is it not apparent that Merlin and Sir Ulfius are thus exalting this unknown boy so that they may elevate themselves along with him?” Thus these discontented kings spake among themselves, and of all of them the most bitter were King Lot and King Urien, who were brothers by marriage with Arthur.<br><br>Now when the Archbishop perceived the discontent of these kings and dukes, he said to them, “How now, Messires! Are ye not satisfied?” And they said, “We are not satisfied.” And the Archbishop said, “What would ye have?” And they said, “We would have another sort of king for Britain than a beardless boy of whom no one knoweth and of whose birthright there are only three men to attest.” And the Archbishop said “What of that? Hath he not performed the miracle that ye yourselves assayed and failed to perform?”<br><br>But these high and mighty lords would not be satisfied, but with angry and averted faces they went away from that place, filled with wrath and indignation.</p>

      <h3> PREVIEW:</h3>
  <p>CHAPTER FIVE<br>PreviousTopNext<br><br><br>Clare switched off her blow-dryer and ran her fingers through her clean hair, fluffing out the blunt-cut ends so that it framed her face in a thick bob. She had showered and dusted herself with fragrant talc and put on her nightgown and warm, wine-red robe. Now she intended to relax for the rest of the evening with a good book to ease the restless tension of her day.<br><br>It was the fourth day of the Deverenkos' stay at Moonlight, and Clare had found it just as difficult as the previous three. Tim's reluctance to go to school was more marked than usual, although Clare had been unprincipled enough to use the bribe of violin lessons with David as she packed him off on the boat each morning in time to catch the school bus which picked him up from the Lake Romata stop on State Highway 86. Today it had been his regular lesson with Cheryl, and when Clare had taken the station wagon—the road was just passable by afternoon—into Rotorua for her 'jazzercise' session at the gym before she ferried Tim to and from his lesson, the Deverenkos had accompanied her. David had gone with Tim to his lesson, while Tamara went to the gym with Clare and watched her join the fifteen or so other women in their energetic dancing. Tamara, who had obviously regretted her confidences of the second day, had thawed slightly as Clare, sweaty from her exertions, had come off the floor.<br><br>'You must have to be awfully fit,' she said wistfully. 'We do—did—gym at school, but it was always boring and sport was compulsory. Ugh, I hated it!'<br><br>'I'm fit, but then I've always danced,' said Clare as they walked towards the changing-rooms. 'But we have new people joining all the time. They just do as much of the routine as they can manage. The important thing is to enjoy it. My working hours are pretty flexible, especially when our bookings are light, so I can come as often, or as little, as I want. Most women find twice a week is enough to keep in shape, especially when they've built up to the full hour session. Maybe you'd like to try it some time.'<br><br>Tamara instantly backed off. 'I've never done any dancing or anything. With all our travelling there was never any time for stuff like that…except music lessons, of course.'<br><br>And yet she said she didn't play an instrument. Tactfully Clare ignored the tail-end of her remark. 'You don't have to be an expert, the instructor demonstrates everything.' She dimpled mischievously. 'And you notice how I always stay at the back? That's so I can watch everyone else instead of them watching me.' She often wondered whether she would have been able to make a career out of ballet even if it hadn't been physically precluded, given her shyness in front of people, but she hadn't been tempted. Dancing in a gym with a group of friendly women was vastly different from doing it on stage. No, this way Clare had the best of both worlds: she could lose herself in the music and the physical enjoyment of dancing without drawing attention to herself.<br><br>'I don't have any of the gear, anyway,' said Tamara, eyeing Clare's slinky purple leotard and blue tights, the pink leg warmers and foreshortened T-shirt she wore.<br><br>'All you need is the leotard and tights, and you can hire those from the gym. Do you want to have a go next time, Tamara?'<br><br>She shrugged, as if afraid of expressing any eagerness. 'I don't know. Dad might want to do something else.'<br><br>'What about what you want to do, Tamara?' asked Clare quietly. 'Why don't you forget your father for once, and be responsible for your own enjoyment? It's not as if this is something your father can join in with. It's sexist, you know, but it is a women-only group.'<br><br>'No, I suppose he couldn't, could he?' Tamara had seemed struck by the novelty of being able to do something her father couldn't. Clare could see her mind ticking over behind the ruffled brow. Nagging her father for attention had backfired; perhaps she might get her revenge by shutting him out! 'But I'm so scrawny.' She looked down at herself with dislike. 'I'll look horrible in those clinging things.'<br><br>'Better than having rolls of fat bulging all over the place,' said Clare briskly. 'We'll just make sure we get you a fattening colour in horizontal stripes, the sort of thing which makes me look like an elephant.'<br><br>Tamara had produced her rare giggle, and Clare had thought what a nice girl she could be when she forgot to shoulder her chip. What she really needed were a few interests of her own. For all her sophistication, in some ways Tamara was less mature than Tim. She had told Clare that she had turned thirteen a few months ago, had shown her the gold locket on a chain that her father had given her, and talked about the party that Deverenko had arranged for her, long distance, since he was in Japan at the time.<br><br>Four days ago Clare might have condemned David Deverenko for abandoning his daughter on her special day, but having seen them together she conceded that he was having every bit as difficult a time of it as Tamara. He undoubtedly loved his daughter, but her prickliness and her unpredictable moods had him at a loss. They spent all day together while Tim was at school and Clare was concentrating on shutting out her intrusive awareness of the new presence at Moonlight in her work, and yet still Tamara wanted more. That made Deverenko impatient with her, which in turn made Tamara sulk. It seemed a vicious circle with no break in sight. To fully satisfy Tamara's demands Deverenko would have to give up his career, sacrifice his love of creating great music for love of his daughter, and if be did that he would not be Deverenko any more. That he realised it was obvious in the dark concern with which be watched his daughter when she was being particularly morose. That Tamara didn't was also obvious. If she did, Clare thought she would probably be horrified at the very idea, and yet that was what she wanted, to be first in her father's life— before his music. There would be even more pain ahead for the girl if she continued the self-destructive round of confrontation and selfish demand. Pain for David, too, watching the slow alienation. Clare's heart ached for both of them.<br><br>'Mum? Are you ready to tuck me up?'<br><br>'Just coming, Tim.' Clare went into his room and began their night-time ritual of discussing their day and planning the next one.<br><br>'Miss Tyson let Mr Deverenko take my lesson today.'<br><br>'Did she?'<br><br>'Then he played us a sonata on her violin. Did you know that he didn't bring his own down with him?'<br><br>'No, I didn't.'<br><br>'I wanted to see it. Did you know it was famous? I looked it up in a book. It's a Guarneri, they're even rarer than Strads, you know. Of course he has a Stradivarius, too, and a Tononi. You'd think he'd have brought one down with him,' Tim's piping voice was much aggrieved. He frowned. 'Unless he's going to leave soon. He couldn't not practise for more than a week, could he, Mum? Not Deverenko!' The thought obviously appalled him. From the first time his chubby toddler's hands had laid on the violin, Tim had played every day. It was unthinkable to spend a day without practising. In all the books he read, it was the cardinal sin.<br><br>'He played today,' Clare pointed out.<br><br>'Not for very long. He practises at least four hours a day, longer than that, too, because of rests.'<br><br>'I'm sure he knows what he's doing,' placated Clare, wondering herself what it portended. She, too, found it difficult to think of David Deverenko without a violin within reach of his magic fingers. 'Perhaps his violins are too valuable to bring down here. No doubt the dampness and central heating wouldn't do them any good.'<br><br>'No, but you'd think he'd have brought an old one.'<br><br>'Why don't you ask him about it?' Clare said. Tim was like a terrier when on the track of a problem. 'How did your maths test go today at school?'<br><br>Tim decided it was time to snuggle down. He wriggled his small body down under the down cover and yawned impressively.<br><br>'Tim?' his mother said warningly, and he sighed, his brown eyes soulful, and so like Lee's that Clare weakened.<br><br>'It was boring, Mum. It was all stuff we've done already.'<br><br>'That's the idea of tests, Tim—to find out what you've learned. If Miss Tyson, or Mr Deverenko,' she added for good measure, 'didn't ask you to play the practice piece you've learned, how would you feel?'<br><br>'That's different. That's never boring.'<br><br>'Not even scales?'<br><br>Tim's mouth firmed stubbornly.<br><br>'I take it you didn't do too well in the test.'<br><br>'I didn't finish it. I got to thinking…' He tailed off as he watched his mother's face cloud over with hurt. He swallowed hard. 'I'm sorry, Mum, but I knew it all, really. It was baby stuff, long division and tables and things.'<br><br>'You should have done the test first, then done your 'thinking',' said Clare firmly, with an inward sigh. She had already warned Tim's schoolteacher that he found the normal maths syllabus no challenge at all. Although Tim was a class ahead of his age group, he still found the work too easy, when he was sufficiently stimulated to tackle it!<br><br>'Never mind.' She leaned forward to kiss his smooth forehead, sprinkled with the freckles that adorned her own. 'I'll have a word with Mrs Campbell.'<br><br>'About book week, too? Why do all my reports have to be on those silly fiction books?'<br><br>'Because it'll do you good to read something imaginative rather than practical for a change.' This was something she had made progress with. 'Fiction is rather like music, Tim…one person's special vision of the world to be shared with others. They're all very well-written stories on the young adult level. I think you might find that you enjoy them.' And learn from them. One was about a gifted young pianist who had to face the fact he might not be able to play again after a car accident. She wanted Tim to realise that there were sometimes other obstacles than lack of talent or application that could get in the way of a burning desire to dedicate one's life to something. She feared for that fierce determination in one so young; it could so easily turn against him.<br><br>'OK, Mum.' Tim gave her the sweet smile that was his special gift. 'I love you, Mum.'<br><br>This was ritual, too. 'I love you, too, Tim. Sweet dreams.' She clicked off his bedside-lamp and went to the door.<br><br>'Mum?'<br><br>'Mmm?'<br><br>'Why can't we remember dreams?'<br><br>Clare smiled to herself in the darkness. Typical of Tim to end the day with a question.<br><br>'Our subconscious protecting itself, perhaps. Why don't you look it up in the library tomorrow?'<br><br>'OK.' Another yawn, but a real one this time.<br><br>Clare was still smiling as she closed his door and went to switch on her automatic kettle while she fetched her book from the bedroom. It was a thrilling spy novel, and Clare was looking forward to a little, vicarious excitement. She switched off the main light in the lounge and put on the table-lamp next to the big, soft velvet sofa. She could hear the kettle beginning to steam, so she tucked the book under her arm and was getting out a cup for herself in the tiny kitchenette when there was a soft rap on the door. Clare sighed.<br><br>David Deverenko's eyebrows shot up when he saw her night attire. He was still wearing the white cashmere sweater and dark trousers he had worn at dinner. 'Going to bed already? Or are you expecting someone else?'<br><br>'Miles is still away.' The impact of him, leaning casually against the doorway, made her snappy defence instantaneous. 'Who else would I be expecting?'<br><br>'While sugar daddy's away… That photographer seems to hang around your office rather a lot.'<br><br>Her surprise was answer enough. 'Doug?' She was undecided whether to be annoyed or amused. Doug was gay. It was far more likely to be David he was interested in than Clare! 'You seem to have it fixed in your mind that I'm some kind of femme fatale,' she said in exasperation. 'I don't know where you get your ideas from, but you're way off beam.' What did he see when he looked at her, for goodness' sake? She was a twenty-seven-year-old mother, not particularly pretty or sexy, living a rather ordinary and unexciting life. 'And Miles is not my sugar daddy,' she was unable to resist adding.<br><br>'Do you sleep with him?'<br><br>'David!'<br><br>'Just want to make sure I'm not stepping on anyone's toes,' he said mildly, accepting her spluttering outrage as his answer.<br><br>'You might get your own crushed,' she warned him grimly.<br><br>'Only might?'<br><br>'Will, then,' she corrected herself, furious at letting him fluster her yet again. She should expect the unexpected from him by now. 'David, I'm tired. What do you want?'<br><br>His eyes gleamed, but he ignored the opening. 'A little company, that's all. Tamara's plugged into some unspeakable horror video—' Clare frowned at this, the freckles between her straight brows forming little ridges, and David sighed '—I checked the rating, little mother, it's OK for teenagers… it may be unspeakable to me, but then I'm a coward about these things. Tamara doesn't seem to find it particularly scary, and I don't think it will be detrimental to her mental health in the long run. I'm not a totally inept father, you know.'<br><br>'I never thought you were,' Clare said faintly, because it seemed to matter to him what she thought.<br><br>'Don't think I haven't felt your disapproving maternal eyes watching us,' he astounded her further by saying, his dark eyes suddenly very much like his daughter's when she was brooding on some slight, real or imagined. 'I can't be a father and mother to her; she remembers Nina far too well to accept my poor efforts as substitute. They were very close. Sometimes I think that her behaviour stems from the fact that she blames me for killing her mother. Nina was flying out to Rome to join me when the plane crashed.'<br><br>'Surely not—' Clare blurted reassuringly. Was that really what he thought? Or was he just voicing his own deep-felt guilt?<br><br>'Look, can I come in? I really don't feel comfortable talking about this in a corridor,' he asked ruefully.<br><br>She hesitated, fighting the automatic reflex to agree. Was this just a ploy to get in the door?<br><br>'I was just about to relax on the couch with a Russian spy,' she murmured, taking the book out from under her arm. Then she realised what she had said and blushed.<br><br>His eyebrows rose again. 'Won't a musician do?' he murmured with sensuous amusement.<br><br>'David…' They both heard the weakness in her voice, and he followed up his advantage.<br><br>'Please? A lonely musician? I'm far safer than a spy.'<br><br>'That's a matter of opinion,' said Clare, to his delight. 'I suppose you can come in,' she sighed, thinking that she must be mad to invite… whatever it was she was inviting. 'But just for a little while,' she warned, more for herself than for him.<br><br>'Just long enough to finish the bottle,' he promised, moving past her.<br><br>'What bottle?' Her eyes fell to the hands which had remained tucked behind him for the short duration of their conversation.<br><br>'This one.' He had two glasses, also, crystal flutes from the bar. The bottle was champagne, vintage Krug at over one hundred dollars a bottle, a filmy chill misting the green glass.<br><br>'We can't drink that.' Clare was used to the extravagance of guests, but her own economical soul balked at sharing it.<br><br>'I'll get drunk if I drink it alone,' he said, putting the glasses down on a coffee-table as she absently shut the door, and ripping the foil off the top of the champagne. 'You wouldn't like me when I'm drunk, Clare; I become very maudlin and depressed, very black-Russian.'<br><br>'You forget, I've seen you knock back the vodka. You couldn't get drunk in a month of Sundays,' said Clare wryly. David had brought the bottles with him, bearing incomprehensible labels in Cyrillic script, and instructed Kerry to keep them in the freezer.<br><br>'Vodka is an exuberant drink, company in itself. Champagne shouldn't be drunk alone, it has tristesse in its bubbles. Here, taste.' He handed her a brimming glass.<br><br>'I hope you put this on the spike,' Clare said to counteract the shivery thrill of the first sip.<br><br>'I do not need to steal for my pleasures, Clare,' he said quietly.<br><br>'I didn't mean…I was joking,' she said awkwardly. She had expected a flippant reply, not this stern dignity. She would never understand the man!<br><br>'So…enjoy. It's not a crime, Clare, to indulge in a little luxury…nor is it one to want to share it with friends.'<br><br>'No, of course not.' She felt terrible now, and she took a large, hasty gulp to make up for it. The bubbles exploded in the back of her throat with a heady burst of dryness that made her nose tingle, and she began to cough. David clicked his tongue and took the forgotten book and the glass from her, and put them down with his own glass on the table before he slapped her sharply between the shoulder-blades.<br><br>'Better?' he asked, as her coughs spluttered to a halt.<br><br>'Yes, thank you.' Her eyes were watering and she was sure her nose must be red. She must really look a sight.<br><br>'Here.' As if to confirm it, he held out a handkerchief and she took it to cover her embarrassment.<br><br>'Thanks.'<br><br>'Let's sit down, shall we?' He indicated the couch. 'For a novice like you, it might be best if you didn't have to worry about drinking and standing up at the same time.'<br><br>'I have had champagne before,' Clare told him tartly, as she returned his handkerchief.<br><br>'But not, judging from your horror, of this quality. Do you know how many dollars' worth you just wasted in that sneeze?'<br><br>It was as if he had read her mind. She glared at him, but the look was wasted. He was showing interest in her robe where the wrapover section had slipped with her choking breaths, his grin fading at the sight of pale lavender lace. He looked up and found her watching him, and there was a breathless moment when neither could look away. Clare was suddenly achingly conscious of her body. Because she had a slight allergy to man-made fibres, she couldn't wear anything but wool, cotton or silk immediately next to her skin. As a result, her underwear and nightwear was all either extremely cheap and prosaic or, like the lavender silk nightgown, sinfully exotic and expensive. It was one of Miles's little gestures of appreciation that each time he came back from overseas he brought his valued Moonlight staff members a gift. For Clare it was invariably underwear, usually French, the kind she could never dream of affording herself. Over two years, she had built up quite a wardrobe, Miles turning a deaf ear to all blushes and protests.<br><br>'I… I think I should go and get dressed,' said Clare nervously, beginning to back away, feeling threatened by the curiosity she could see in the dark eyes. He wanted to see what the lace was attached to, and to her horror Clare could feel her breasts tingling against their fine silk covering.<br><br>'No!' The word jerked out, uncomfortably loud in the small room. 'No, don't run away.' He smiled soothingly at her, his voice warm and encouraging as he picked up her glass and handed it to her, resolutely keeping his eyes away from her intriguing neckline. 'Just a few drinks and a little conversation, Clare. Where's the harm in that, mmm? Sit down. Don't be so tense. Nothing terrible is going to happen.'<br><br>That was debatable, Clare thought as she numbly obeyed. Something terrible had already happened. She had wanted him to look at her…to touch her. She looked blindly down into her glass. It hurt, this wanting. It was wrong…<br><br>'Don't look so tragic, Clare. There's nothing wrong with a man looking at a woman, or vice versa. It doesn't have to lead to anything,' he said as he sat beside her, and the hint of amusement stung. Clare lifted her chin.<br><br>'It won't.'<br><br>'Of course it won't…if you don't want it to.' He smiled at her with a beguiling tenderness. It surprised her, this gentleness in a man who looked so harsh and masculine.<br><br>'Now…what were we talking about before we were…distracted? Ah, yes, my daughter. Dare I suggest that I think you might be good for her? That damned school she was at seems to have had no idea how to control her.'<br><br>'Is that what you want? For her to be controlled?' asked Clare, relaxing fractionally now that the conversation was focused on him.<br><br>'I put that badly. Not controlled—channelled. She has much energy but no sense of focus, no ambition… beyond this fixation that she wants to look after me.'<br><br>'What's so awful about that? You're her father, the only family she has. It's natural she should want to be with you.'<br><br>'Actually I'm not—her only family, that is. Nina's parents are still alive. They live in Paris and they'd be happy to have Tamara live with them and go to day school there, but she rejected that idea, too. It's not just being with me she wants, Clare; she wants to do things that a wife does. She wants to be a replacement for Nina, and I can't let her do that—to herself or to me.'<br><br>'Oh?' Clare was lost. Surely he didn't mean…she moistened her suddenly dry mouth with champagne. No, not David, his instincts were very healthy…<br><br>'Why are you looking at me like that? As if I am from under a stone?' She blushed, and his eyes narrowed to black slits. 'Clare? Surely you don't imagine…?' He swore. It was in Russian but she was positive it was a swear word. 'Clare!' For a moment she thought he was going to snatch back his champagne and storm out, then he threw back his dark shaggy head and began to laugh.<br><br>'For one who tries to be so controlled, you have a shockingly uncontrolled imagination,' he said, enjoying her discomfort.<br><br>Was that how she appeared to him? Controlled? Oh, thank goodness! thought Clare.<br><br>'I was not talking sexually, my prurient-minded madonna,' he reproved as he refilled her drained glass. 'I meant emotionally. It's not as if I require a replacement for Nina; that part of my life is now finished…' Did that mean he didn't intend to marry again? There certainly didn't seem to be room in his schedule for another wife. 'And certainly I don't want Tamara to be one of those people who sacrifice their own lives to the safety of living it vicariously through others, forming obsessive ties in the process.'<br><br>Clare stiffened. Was that a dig at her? She looked at him sharply, but he was staring out of the large picture window at the moonlit lake. All the rooms faced the lake, and on clear nights like tonight, with the moon full and heavy, a silver pathway opened across the still waters.<br><br>'Perhaps she doesn't see it as a sacrifice,' Clare pointed out gently. 'Perhaps she wants to do it out of love.'<br><br>'But that's what it would be. She would be Deverenko's daughter, not Tamara.'<br><br>'She's that already.'<br><br>'No, she's that still.' He looked up and caught her struggle to understand. He leaned forward, the dark fabric stretching across his broad thighs. 'Love and independence aren't incompatible, Clare. I want Tamara to discover that herself; I want her to finish her schooling, to have the experience of friendships and knowledge beyond the tight musical circle that encompasses me.'<br><br>'You can't force her into independence, not if you want to keep her love.'<br><br>He sighed. 'I know, but what can I do? We've tried tutors and companions. It worked while Nina was alive, because she made sure that Tamara respected them, but when I'm travelling and performing I don't have the time to give her the continuity of supervision that she received when we were a family unit. She ran rings around every woman I hired—and fired. So then we tried her grandparents—and now the school. Tamara has become an expert in lack of co-operation, in running away from situations she doesn't want to face. I fear for her, Clare, but I believe that if I give in to her manipulating I'll be creating a rod for both of our backs. Do you know she used to play the piano and violin? But since Nina died she has just refused to play any more. I won't say she had great talent, but she was a competent player—'<br><br>'Damned with faint praise,' murmured Clare.<br><br>His dark eyes were fierce. He tipped back his head and swallowed his champagne in one hard gulp, as if it were vodka. 'Damn you, I wasn't being condescending. I don't care whether she's a virtuoso or not. In fact, I was glad she didn't seem to care about a career in music-it's a hell of a struggle in the middle ranks—but music for pleasure…to play for pleasure, one's own pleasure… she knows how important that is to me. She wants to share in my life, yet she won't share this vital pleasure with me. I don't care if she never has another lesson—but to turn her back on it entirely, it wounds me.'<br><br>'Perhaps that's her intent.' Yes, to a man with music in his soul, it would be a powerful weapon to use against him.<br><br>'It probably is. That's also disturbing. I don't want her to gear her life to pleasing or displeasing me.'<br><br>'That's a father's fate, I'm afraid.'<br><br>'And a mother's?' he asked broodingly. 'Does Tim cause you to run around in circles?'<br><br>'Tim is different; he has his focus, as you do, and he's still very young. I know people who have teenage children and they invariably tell me that daughters are the most difficult—or perhaps it's just their sexist expectations, thinking that girls should be sweet and placid and obedient. Tamara has spirit, you should be glad of that, and she's of an age where most girls start to resist the authority of their mothers. Tamara's training her sights on the next best thing… you. As long as she knows that you love her and won't turn your back on her—'<br><br>'You mean I should give in to her?' he said sullenly. Obviously he was not happy with the direction of the conversation. Did he expect her to automatically side with him? Was that the way it usually went when he poured out his troubles into a willing female ear? Did they murmur, 'OK you poor darling,' and fall into his hands like ripe plums?<br><br>'No, I mean never give up caring, being angry or stern, or autocratic, all the things that fathers are meant to be. As long as you resist her resistance, she'll know you care.'<br><br>'You're very wise.'<br><br>He wasn't being sarcastic. The brooding look had been replaced with a wry warmth that made her blush as if he had said something outrageous. She looked quickly away, sternly reminding herself of those ripe plums.<br><br>'Here I'm supposed to be learning about you and Tim, and all I've done is talk about myself,' he said softly. 'I'm sorry if I've been boring.'<br><br>'Don't be ridiculous,' she said, sure that he was teasing her. David? Boring? He had just given her a fascinating glimpse of the man behind the violin, the very human man. 'You're far more interesting than I am.'<br><br>'You think so?'<br><br>There was no mistaking the tenor of that murmur. Clare felt her skin heat up all over again, and she fiddled with her glass. 'Of course. You've done much more with your life than I have with mine.'<br><br>'What's that got to do with it? The most sophisticated people can also be the most boring. Look at the lake out there—it's quiet, unspoiled, with a natural beauty that makes one ache. It looks empty, but it's teeming with life at all levels. You could live a lifetime here and never know it all. I have the feeling that you're like the lake, Clare: you have a wealth of fascination under that beautifully still exterior. Is there fire beneath the ice, Clare? These beautiful lakes were created out of fire, weren't they?'<br><br>'I… I think you'd better go.' Clare set down her glass with a click, feeling unbearably flustered. Was he saying he thought she was beautiful and fascinating, after all the beautiful, fascinating women he must have known? She wouldn't let herself believe the lie.<br><br>'Why? Have I embarrassed you? By complimenting you? Why do you treat me so gracelessly? Didn't your husband teach you to accept compliments in the spirit in which they are offered? Didn't he tell you that you were beautiful?'<br><br>Clare couldn't bring herself to look at him in case he was laughing at her. Her hands were twisting in her lap. She felt as if she was on a train, rushing towards some unknown destination. 'Yes, but—'<br><br>'But what?' he asked, distracted by the new freckles revealed by her charming blush.<br><br>'But he wasn't...flirting.'<br><br>'He didn't flirt with you?' He frowned disapprovingly.<br><br>'Yes—no—you're confusing me,' she said feebly, wishing now that she still had her glass to fiddle with. 'Lee was my husband.'<br><br>'And you were a faithful wife?'<br><br>'Very,' she said firmly.<br><br>'And you still are?' There was a faint question mark at the end of his soft statement, but Clare ignored it. Certainly her thoughts of the last few days hadn't been very faithful to Lee's memory. She got up, suddenly stricken with guilt, but before she could suggest that he leave David changed tack.<br><br>'Virginia said that Lee played classical guitar. She said that he had a very bright career ahead of him.'<br><br>Clare half turned, so he wouldn't see the quiver of her mouth. She would bet all she had that Virginia hadn't mentioned the other side of the coin, her son's bright career in rock. 'Yes,' she said. 'Everyone agreed he had loads of talent. It's a pity he didn't record more than he did.'<br><br>'You mean he made a record!' David's surprise contained a faint suspicion he was being had. Clare looked too sweet and rosy and innocent and amused.<br><br>'He made several professional recordings. He wasn't famous by your standards, of course, but within New Zealand he was very well-known.'<br><br>'Then why haven't I heard of him? Did he record under another name?' She could see David sifting through his formidable memory.<br><br>'No, his own. In fact, I have one of his albums here. Would you like to hear a track?'<br><br>'I'd love to,' he said with enthusiasm. Not only would he be able to satisfy his curiosity about Clare's husband, but he would have an excuse to stay in the quiet intimacy of her company for a little longer.<br><br>Clare found the Myth album and put it on the turntable, making sure that David didn't get a glimpse of the cover. She adjusted the volume fairly high. The rooms at Moonlight were all insulated and fairly well sound-proofed, and Tim was a solid sleeper.<br><br>She wished she had a camera when the first thundering chords of the electric guitar vibrated around the lounge. David winced, shock, dismay and finally comprehension streaking across his dark features. Clare was openly laughing at him when he rose slowly to his feet.<br><br>'This is your husband?'<br><br>The vocals started and Clare turned the volume down slightly as she nodded, her eyes limpid blue. 'What's the matter, don't you like it?' She was fairly sure of his answer, and was therefore stunned when he tilted his head and listened for a moment to the strong, husky voice doing the vocals and the clever, catchy rhythm that threaded behind it, beginning to click his fingers and move to the beat.<br><br>'It's good. I like it.' And as if that entirely settled the matter he moved towards her, still in rhythm, shoulders and hips gliding sinuously in time. 'Dance with me.'<br><br>'We can't,' said Clare automatically, dragging her eyes away from the intriguing tilt of his pelvis.<br><br>'Why not? There's nobody to see us.' He danced around like the Pied Piper, forcing her to turn to keep him safely in sight. 'Doesn't the music make you want to move? That's the hallmark of good rock, it makes you want to illustrate the beat. Come on, Clare,' he invited mockingly, 'you know it's irresistible…'<br><br>And it was. She was already swaying without realising it. 'This is ridiculous,' she whispered as she let him loosely clasp her wrist and draw her across the lounge to the empty space in front of the big windows. He was a marvellous mover and she couldn't help but respond, her own love of dancing overtaking her, challenging her to better him. Soon they were embarking on an absorbing interaction that banished her self-consciousness. She wasn't even aware that one track had melted into another, until David's hands were at her waist and she realised that they had reached the slow number, the last one on that side. They had been dancing for twenty minutes. When she tried to ease out of his grip he wouldn't let her. He held her wary eyes with his, drawing her into their dark fascination, beckoning her with the tantalising brush of his body.<br><br>'We move well together, don't we?' he murmured smokily, his hands on her waist turning her so that her hip moved against his, one of his thighs briefly pressing between her legs. He turned her again before she could protest the intimacy…if she had wanted to. They danced in silence a few moments longer, then the eyes which held her captive dropped to her mouth. Clare became exquisitely conscious of his body, the arousal that he teased her with every time he moved against her. Yet perversely she didn't feel threatened. Yes, he was aroused and not trying to hide it, but explicit in the dark admiration of his eyes, was the promise of seduction, not rape. His body, though taut with desire, was relaxed, asking rather than demanding.<br><br>'David…' she began shakily, trying to find the strength of will to deny the unspoken question.<br><br>'Do you like the taste of my name in your mouth?' he whispered, eyes dark slits as he watched her lips move.<br><br>She wanted to taste more than his name, and he knew it. Clare shivered, pressing herself inadvertently against him, and he gave a soft groan.<br><br>'Yes, darling… move like that… again… Clare…' One hand was now binding her waist, the other sliding up into her thick, clean hair. 'Mmm, you smell so good…' He continued his erotic dance as he kissed her, enjoying the faint quiver of her mouth before it opened obediently to the gentle thrust of his tongue, accepting the inevitable. She filled his senses, her warm, womanly curves fitting to him, making him arch to relieve the ache that was threatening to explode. It wasn't enough. He broke the kiss slowly and with the greatest of reluctance, his fingers tightening in her hair as he looked down at her upturned face, flushed with the heat of mutual desire. Her eyes were the colour of a stormy sky, her mouth as lush and ripe as the rest of her, faintly swollen by his quest for the pleasure within. Had he bitten her in his delirium? He lifted his hand from her waist to trace the over-full bow.<br><br>'You have a lovely mouth.' It seemed natural to let his hand sink down again, over the delicate arch of her jaw, down her soft, warm throat to the creamy, freckled triangle of skin above the modest embrace of her robe. Clare's eyes fluttered closed, shutting out the hunger that hardened the aggressive angles of his face. She mustn't see…she mustn't let him see, know, how much she wanted to appease that very male hunger.<br><br>He knew what she was doing. 'Don't hide from me, Clare. You don't have to hide yourself from me.' He kissed her again, and from somewhere Clare found the sense to stiffen the arms she had braced against the hard wall of his chest. Even so, her tongue curled treacherously around his as she dragged her mouth away, as if she couldn't bear to let go of the sinful delight of the symbolic possession.<br><br>'No, please…' She couldn't seem to breathe very well, the roomy robe seemed too tight. 'David…'<br><br>'It's all right, it's all right, Clare,' he soothed her trembling with tender kisses along her averted jawline, his fingers abandoning their tormenting of that tender triangle of skin as they moved instead to the tie of her robe. 'It's all right. I'm going to go. I just want to see what you're hiding. I won't hurt or frighten you…'<br><br>He wouldn't, but Clare frightened herself. She wanted him to see her body, even though she was afraid he would find it disappointing. She looked at his face, dark and intent, as he slowly unwrapped her robe, deliberately prolonging the agonising moment of anticipation.<br><br>His hand clenched on the soft lapel of the robe as he stared at the lavender drift of pure silk which faithfully loved every dip and curve of her body from breast to knee. The lace bodice cupped her breasts with exquisite restraint, the transparencies in the pattern providing tantalising glimpses of creamy flesh bearing its own random pattern of freckles. The tight points were modestly covered, but that only made them all the more obvious.<br><br>Clare waited for him to touch her, to slide the silk against her heated skin, her abandonment complete as she saw not disappointment but the flattery of raw desire in his silent appreciation.<br><br>He sighed, the hard body seeming to arch slightly towards her yearningly before he shook his shaggy head and firmly rewrapped her robe, tying it more tightly than was necessary.<br><br>Clare went pale, then hot with shame. She had practically melted into his arms, and he didn't want her. He had been just flirting. Probably he was amused that she was so easy, after all! She tried to pull away, but he wouldn't let her.<br><br>'Clare, do you know what the time is?'<br><br>'What?'<br><br>'Tamara's movie will be over. And if I know her, she's not going to sit quietly in our room until I come back. She's going to come looking for me.'<br><br>'Oh?' Clare's eyes shot everywhere but to his face, and he gave her a little, sharp shake.<br><br>'Clare, I'd love nothing better than to make love to you in that lavender piece of nothing, but even now you're having trouble looking me in the eye. Imagine how it would be tomorrow morning, if I stayed and did what we both want. I came here to talk, not to seduce you. The seduction comes later.'<br><br>'Oh, really? You mean you have a schedule you have to stick to?' said Clare, infuriated enough by his arrogance to glare directly at him.<br><br>'No. But I think you do. I don't think that you're the kind of woman to sleep with a man on the first date.'<br><br>'This wasn't a date!'<br><br>'Even worse!' He looked shocked, and she very nearly succumbed to his teasing. Just in time, she stopped the smile.<br><br>'David—'<br><br>'Let it go, Clare. You really don't want to pursue this.' And suddenly she didn't. He looked all too confident of where it would lead. She wished she had the kind of sophistication that could shrug off what just happened.<br><br>'Now, show me nicely to the door and give me a consoling goodnight kiss, and bear in mind when you wake up next morning that I've been incredibly self-sacrificing!'<br><br>Smug wretch! He didn't get his kiss, but it didn't seem to bother him. Clare could hear him chuckling all the way back down the hall to his room.<br><br>She went over and switched off the stereo, offering a silent apology to Lee's photograph on the back of the album cover.<br><br>If only Lee were here to protect her now. The trouble was that he wasn't, and she couldn't help remembering one of the last things he'd said to her, in the hospital, when he knew there was not much time left.<br><br>'Life is for living, Clare, you just remember that. You've gotta take your chances as they come. If you don't, you're only half living!'</p>
